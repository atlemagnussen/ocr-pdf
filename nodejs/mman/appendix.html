        <h3 id="multidimensional-model">Multidimensional model</h3>
        <p>
          The Diagram shows a crude model of the dimensions. It could be reversed,the
          physical on the inside, the higher dimensions on the outside, or it couldbe_a
          flat infinite plane. The model does not adequately lend itself for
        </p>
        <p>
          illustration for obvious reason, as we are really dealing with states
          ofconsciousness.
        </p>
        <p>Multidimensional model:</p>
        <p>Physical Dimension‘a Physical Universes</p>
        <p>Higher DimensionsMental or HeavenDimensions</p>
        <p>DimensionalCounter Parts</p>
        <p>Physical Dimension& Physical Universes</p>
        <p>
          However, this diagram should provide an idea of the relationshipsbetween the
          dimensions. The physical dimensions on the outside indicatethere could be any
          number of physical universes. Ours is just one of the blackdots. Please note
          the globular strings on the right, getting bigger as theyreach down towards
          their original source. The underlying universes are
        </p>
        <p>
          - massively larger than the physical one, which is only a minute fraction of
          thewhole. The higher-dimensional universes get larger and more numerous asthey
          approach their origin, and they acquire massive increases of creativepower the
          closer they get. There could be any number of creations withinfinite
          dimensions and unlimited universes. They are linear as well asparallel. Each
          globular hierarchy represents a universe with its underlyingcounterpart,
          getting more massive as the dimensions approach their origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          A similar model can be applied to the Solar system, with the physicalplanets
          represented by the dark dots sitting on the outer surface of the skin;and
          further into the model are other planets, which have not manifested inthe
          physical solar system. Their counterparts on the nonphysical
          dimensionsincrease in number as well as dimension the closer they get to their
          original
        </p>
        <p>
          ; creation dimension, which means there are_additional planets in the solar|
          system that don't have a physical counterpart at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          So on each dimension there are numerous counterparts of Earth, gettinglarger
          and larger (so there is never any chance of any overcrowding).
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to what the diagram suggests, the dimensions towards thecreative
          centre become vaster exponentially. It is best to imagine it ascreative
          trickle-down effect. As the matter becomes coarser and
          densertoward_physical_manifestation, the manifestation becomes
          progressivelysparser until we get to the relatively sparsely populated
          physical universe.Scientists estimate that our visible universe is only 4% of
          its total. The rest ismade out of dark matter. The phrase ‘dark matter’
          indicates simply that wedon't know what the matter is. I would rather call it
          the ‘light matter’,consistent with the model as a representation of
          multidimensionality, whichaccount for the bits science can't explain as yet.
          The problem science faces isthat as soon as it unlocks the mystery of the next
          dimension beneath thestructure of our matter and the universe, it will find
          another dimensionimmediately, which is just as hard to penetrate, and so on
          and on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only way to solve the mystery adequately is through consciousnesswith a
          scientific mindset, but it has got to reach beyond thought. Theproblem is that
          when scientists reach that point they will probably
        </p>
        <p>
          understand the relative insignificance of their quest in the light of what
          theyexperience. But it’s worth trying, from a very human point-of-view.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comparison is a bit like seeing our galaxy as representing thephysical
          universe and the whole universe with its billions of galaxies as thehigher
          dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the higher we go into them, the more diverse things become.
          Whenexperiencing what I referred to as the ‘heavens’, I noticed their
          structureseemed to be formed like an infinite sponge, with one chamber leading
          to thenext, divided only by shifts of awareness rather than space._,
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the diagram shows only five membranes, they are in factsubdivided
          much more than could be illustrated, whereas in the narrative, Isubdivided
          them into six: physical, Earth-like, intermediate, higher, heaven,and _pure
          reality. Pure reality may yet consist of further subdivisions, whichmay be
          beyond reach for man at its present evolutionary stage. Also,
        </p>
        <p>
          — different parallel universes become accessible the higher the
          consciousnessrises. Space travel is possible already on the next dimension
          from Earthbecause there space can be collapsed, but only for the
          out-of-body-traveller atpresent.
        </p>
        <p>
          To collapse linear time, a still higher dimension is required, and at alower
          level only the past can be accessed”s,
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any theory, interpretations of my experiences are wide open todebate.
          After all, mine are the observations of an artist rather than a
          qualifiedtheoretical scientist or mathematician.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would be keen to read out-of-body reports from astrophysicists andother
          scientists. All they need to do to find ‘the answer’ is to pose thequestion
          when out of their body and allow the magnetic energy of theirdesire for
          knowledge to guide them to the right source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, when illustrating a book on Deep Space, I became fascinatedabout the
          question of the origin of our universe. When out of my body Iposed the
          question of how the universe began I hoped to become the
        </p>
        <p>
          eyewitness to the Big Bang. To my great surprise I was confronted with
          foursounds. I know that scientifically sounds are the result of waveforms; but
          arethey really? Could there be another dimension where sound creates waveforms
          rather than the other way around? And what is sound anyway? Soundplays an
          incredibly important role when visiting the higher dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment the only theory we have is still the Big Bang, but I amsure we
          will become more specific as our knowledge increases.

        <h2>Appendix B</h2>
        <h3 id="the-super-powers">The super powers</h3>
        <p>
          Very early on in my investigations I concluded that objective creation
          existson other dimensions in exactly the same way as creation exists in the
          physicaluniverse, regardless of the observer. The idea that we are dealing
          with vagueor vaporous matter - the product of dreams and imagination - is
          utterlyabsurd when waking in the actual environment of the higher
          dimensions.Experiencing firsthand such a vast and magnificent world with such
          clarityand detachment is just something that cannot be conveyed adequately
          inwords,
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand it is tempting to conclude that because the creativepowers
          of imagination, expectation and intention play such an active part inthe
          shaping of the environment, the next dimension is nothing more than aproduct
          of the imagination. But even that doesn’t make it any less real to theobserver
          who finds himself inhabiting that dimension, Once the physicalviewpoint has
          disappeared, upon entering the next dimension, we will getaccustomed to a
          totally new experience of reality, one that follows new andexciting laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘My most important observation was that the energy of creation on thesehigher
          dimension is far more pliable and adaptable to various forces than o1the
          physical strata. The major one is the universal force of creation, the
          samewhich brought our physical universe into existence. But there are other
          forcesthat manipulate the energy in any way they want, as the energy is so
          muchmore fluid and dynamic than in the physical universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas on the physical level we need to employ physical means toshift
          physical matter, on the levels above one employs mental means to shiftmental
          matter, but the mental matter is not less real than physical matter ison the
          physical plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only are those universes not vaporous, they appear extremely solidonce the
          visitor has taken residence there, in the same way as our physicaluniverse
          appears solid to us. Just because it can be manipulated moredynamically than
          matter on Earth doesn’t make it less real, in the same way
        </p>
        <p>219</p>
        <p>
          cothat water is not less real than rock because it can be transformed into ice
          andsteam and can be forced into different molds.
        </p>
        <p>
          What really determines reality is a state of awareness. The higher werise
          through the inner dimensions and the closer we get to our innermostlayer of
          consciousness, the more powerful the awareness of being and lifebecomes. From
          our earthly viewpoint we prefer to look upon the higherdimension as being
          flimsy, vaporous and phantom-like simply because weplace it firmly in the
          realm of imagination, In fact, the opposite is the case.Once_one has awoken on
          the higher planes, Earth life appears as a dimdream. The power of
          consciousness increases proportionally the higher weascend through the
          different dimensions. All our sensory powers and humanfaculties of awareness
          increase as well. This is why in Buddhism the state ofthe higher consciousness
          is referred to as the awakened state. We have to getused to the idea that we
          are nothing more than universal energy trapped inadream from which we will
          awake gradually into our proper life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing we will have to get used to is that our new environmentwill be
          much more dynamic and responsive to our thoughts and desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum scientists are knocking at the doors of the next dimension,and have
          already discovered that simply by their presence the experimenterhas an effect
          on the behavior of matter on the subatomic level (this is called‘the observer
          effect’), and research is underway to measure the influence ofthought on
          microscopic growth and crystal formation. If this is the effect theobserver
          has on the relatively coarse physical matter, then it is easy tounderstand
          that when we have broken through the barriers of the subatomicstructures into
          the next dimension, these influences are much morepronounced.
        </p>
        <p>And this is exactly what I found.</p>
        <p>
          In this book are many reports that illustrate this point, like the people
          inthe carnival procession shaping matter, including their own bodies,
          intoextravagant shapes, showing that matter in the next dimension is
          infinitelymore pliable, fluid and adaptable to other energy forms such as
          intent andcreative thought. All this will be exploited to the extreme by us as
          humansonce we take a more ‘permanent’ residence in the higher dimensions.
          Beingsuch a very inventive, adaptable and creative species, we come into our
          ownwhen transcending our physical limitations and boundaries after we
          ‘die’.Our passions and energies are set in motion while still on Earth
          andenhanced incredibly on the next dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inhabitants basically employ five types of power whenmanipulating the
          subtle dimensions; the power of intent, the power ofexpectation, the power of
          the subconscious, the power of desire and thepower of consensus.
        </p>

        <h3 id="the-power-of-intent">The power of intent</h3>
        <p>
          I found there are a number of human-induced forces that shape, mold andshift
          matter on other dimensions. One of them is the power of intent. Thiscreative
          force allows the inhabitants, including visitors like myself, tomanipulate the
          matter and the world to an incredible degree and to make itconform to any wish
          we are capable of dreaming up. This power gets moreintense the higher the
          dimension. These energies can be so potent that theycan even include the
          apparent creation of other living entities, which Idescribed when visiting the
          1920s colonisation of an alien planet,
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point it is worth considering the implication of these forces onthe
          environment of the inhabitants. To my great astonishment I found thatnot only
          the thoughts of the permanent residents shaped their environment,but that we,
          still living on this physical plane, are responsible for some thefeatures of
          their world. On one occasion in the late seventies I was given aguided tour
          through a very modern hotel by the designer on the nexdimension. The modern,
          mold-breaking design was akin to what you cainow find in boutique hotels and
          in some of the most avant-garde architectureand interior design, but
          manifested years before anything like it was built onthe physical level. It
          was no doubt dreamed up by the designers of suchbuildings on the physical
          level and inspired by the resident designers on thatother level.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can easily imagine the kind of paradise awaiting artists,
          designers,architects and filmmakers over there, where the restrictions of
          money,materials, manpower, gravity and other earthly limitations simply do
          notapply. The environments created there are of such astounding
          creativity,variety and sheer inventiveness, that they would be nigh-on
          impossible toachieve on Earth because of the resilience of our matter and its
          gravitationallaws.
        </p>
        <p>25 See chapter “Settlers on another planet”</p>

        <h3 id="the-power-of-expectation">The power of expectation</h3>
        <p>
          Another force of creative power is expectation. On
          numerous occasions Ifound that expectation was such a powerful energy it could
          bring objects intoexistence almost instantly. When looking down on my body,
          for example,and wondering what I was wearing, I was always dressed. But I am
          certainthat the power of expectation plays a much greater part in shaping
          theenvironment of the higher dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a power which is based on what we know to be true, and it takes itspower
          from an underlying principle in nature which has proven itself overtime and
          evolution. I refer to it as ‘the matrix’. The matrix is a cosmic energypattern
          containing the blueprint of everything in existence, or even thoughtof. Simply
          by expecting something, we conjure up its latent pattern andpropel it into
          existence in an instant. Expectation is such a powerful, directroute to
          creation because it contains no weakening factors like doubt orindecisiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also applies to motion. The moment we expect to be in a certainplace, we
          are there. If we expect to be dressed we are in the kind of dress orcostume we
          expect. The blueprint of creation is already dormant. It is etched,or
          hardwired, into a cosmic matrix, waiting to be conjured up and releasedinto
          the world. You could compare it to a computer calling up informationfrom its
          hard drive and then running a program.
        </p>
        <p>
          This principle will become a major point of reliance in the physicalsciences
          of the future, because organising physical atoms around these lawsis only a
          matter of degree.
        </p>

        <h3 id="the-power-of-the-subconscious">The power of the subconscious</h3>
        <p>
          Other forces at work on the next dimension are
          subconscious forces thatshape our dreams and nightmares. I am certain that the
          dreamworld weenter during sleep borrows its substance from the matter of the
          nonphysicaldimension. As I have never actually witnessed other people's dreams
          I haveconcluded that we, as dreamers, create the dream content, which vibrates
          ona dimension attuned totally to our own vibratory field and therefore
          invisibleto other people. Whether we can enter other people’s dreams I do not
          know,but Ihave never been aware that what I have witnessed was somebody
          else’screation.I have, however, met people who were dreaming. They can
          beidentified by a strange remoteness, sometimes distressed. sometimesagitated,
          very similar to when we come across people who are daydreaming.Ian sense when
          I meet dreamers who have made their way into the nextdimension but are
          engrossed in a dream. Sometimes they are even involvedin some form of activity
          while dreaming, similar to sleepwalkers on thislevel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subconscious forces are energies we carry over to the next world. In thehigher
          planes they release the energies of life-long dreams. If we wished for
          asupercar on the physical world, but were never able to earn enough moneyto
          afford it, then the energy builds up in those fantasies and dreams nowcomes to
          the fore and finally our dreams come true. A large part of our
          futureenvironment is based on our dreams and wishes - strong energies built
          upduring our lifetime, now set for release and fulfillment. Science can teach
          usthat energy does not get lost, but triggers other events. The events find
          theirmanifestation on the next dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the higher levels we can_all be ‘lottery winners’. If you are areasonably
          positively-charged and motivated person then your dreams willcome true. So you
          can stop buying lottery tickets and be patient instead. Ifyou nurture powerful
          dreams then they will all come true in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you are negatively charged, selfish and out to get the better ofother
          people to further your game-plan, keep buying those tickets, becausethis will
          be your best chance of fulfilling your dreams. To access the matrix,you need
          positive emotions or you may have a long time to wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          Negative energies also form part of these subconscious forces. On thelower
          dimension they can have hideous nightmarish manifestations, whichwill create
          another horrific aspect to the life of the individual inhabitants. Thebest
          illustration is that of a criminal who may have murdered or committedan act of
          violence against another person: the negative energy of his victim,and the
          suffering, resentment and anger of the victim’s family, createspowerful forces
          that often manifest in hideous and violent artificial entities.Like wishes,
          these too are energies which accumulate, if they cannot find fullexpression in
          this dimension. These will attach themselves to the criminaland unload their
          viciousness when he or she has the least protection - afterdeath,
        </p>

        <h3 id="the-power-of-desire">The power of desire</h3>
        <p>
          In occult literature the next dimension to our
          physical one is often referred toas the “desire world”. Emotion is one of the
          predominant and most powerfulforces, but our body on the physical with its
          relatively sluggish neural systemgives us a degree of protection against
          overwhelming emotions. I also foundthat a whole new spectrum of emotions opens
          up to us on the next levelwhich we may never have experienced before here on
          earth. My ownexperience has been that feelings were amplified greatly. Here
          they flowfreely and the person who is not in control of their emotions will
          quickly beconfronted with the effects they conjure up. I could easily break
          into tears ofjoy on the next level when meeting someone I loved and then,
          uponreturning to my physical body, find no trace of that emotion.‘One of the
          most powerful feelings for man or woman is sexual desire.Once it comes to the
          surface on the next level a person is instantly catapultedinto the company of
          like-minded people. I found that these feelings aregenerally more accepted on
          the next level, probably because they are such astrong and integral part of
          our human nature. They are less easily suppressedthere and have been more
          readily accepted as an everyday part of the social7, environment, but that
          doesn’t mean sex is rampant, because people naturallychoose their social
          environment in much the same way as they do on earth.Emotional power can
          create a whole range of artificial entities, whichcan be beautiful angelic
          creatures, brought about by intensive love foranother person, like that of a
          mother for her child or between lovers. I canimagine that Cupid and Amor may
          have originated here. Although their lifeforce is dependent on the will of
          their creators, they are neverthelessconvincing copies of their human

          We have seen the vast creative as well as the destructive power of
          thesubconscious. But there is another formidable force which has
          imprinteditself in the next dimensions: the power of consensus - the combined
          creativeforce of man, which on this planet has led to the creation of
          wholecivilisations, cities and cultures. Take this to another level, where the
          physicaland economic laws no longer apply, and you can imagine what man might
          becapable of. The most exiting encounters I discovered was when every aspect
        </p>
        <p>
          of creation man had achieved on Earth was enhanced exponentially,diversified
          and elaborated on the next dimensions, There were even creationswhich had no
          counterpart anywhere on Earth,
        </p>
        <p>
          The combined will of creativity can achieve worlds of suchmagnificence and
          grandeur that can leave us Earth dwellers absolutelyspeechless. This communal
          power can create whole worlds - civilisations thatpay homage to us as the
          masters of the universe. In the physical level, we as aspecies have achieved
          great things in architecture, art and culture; but in theabsence of physical
          resistance, and with the pliable and fluid matter of thenext dimension at our
          free disposal, imagination is not hampered by materiallimitation and whatever
          can be imagined on this level is a physical realitysomewhere on the next
          dimension.
        </p>
        <p>Some_of the cities I saw were tens of thousands of years old:</p>
        <p>
          — indestructible by the consensual agreement of the people who lived there.
          Inthe face of this we should prepare ourselves for the greatest adventure of
          ourlives at the moment we pass through the gates of death, and yet it very
          muchdepends on our own capacity of imagination whether we will be attracted
          tolook forward to seeing such grandiose monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important, though, to remember the law of attraction. Many of uson this
          planet make little use of our imaginative powers or our sense ofadventure. It
          is obvious that our afterlife environment will be in keeping withwhat we
          expect (i.e. what we are used to), plus elements of our dreams. Thesame is to
          be said about belief systems, which too will create the environmer|sought by
          those who subscribe to it. A vast number of people may quithappily settle in
          environments little different from our physical world; but ofcourse, as
          boredom sets in, so does the desire to extend the comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diversity of our increased power on other levels extends, of
          course,throughout all cultures. It is important to remember that people of
          nationswith unique cultural heritage will enhance their world in line with
          theiridentity.

          I once travelled to the higher dimensional counterpart ofThailand. There I
          came across a water-world consisting of thousands oflittle islands. Each
          island was occupied by families or groups of people.The atmosphere was very
          serene. The waterways separating the littleislands were illuminated by
          millions of lanterns, and the richvegetation and flowers on the earth grew to
          such height that they
        </p>
        <p>
          melded seamlessly into the dwellings of the families in their
          paradisecommunities. Each island was unique and individual and yet blendedwith
          all the others in perfect harmony. There was plenty of singing,
        </p>
        <p>
          [rus and laughter, and everyone was extremely attractive andfriendly towards
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘There was no sense of monotony in this environment. As I driftedthrough the
          island world with a sense of anticipation I found myselfsurprised by the
          unique character of each of the islands, dwellings andstructures. It was a
          continuously unfolding world of wonder. I couldsee children underwater,
          chasing exotic fish and dolphins in thebreathtakingly beautiful reefs. I dived
          in too, (I was able to breathewithout any fear of drowning), and encountered a
          rich underwaterkingdom with a multitude of different creatures I had never
          seen orheard of before.
        </p>

          People who are accustomed to going on regular holidays may well feelinclined
          to spend a few Earth equivalent centuries exploring the higherdimensional
          counterparts of our world when they die.

        <p>
          The closest we will ever get to creating artificial life forms on this
          physicaldimension is via the construction of robots or nano-bots, which we
          canprogram to perform certain tasks. The further we advance
          technologically,the more realistic such artificial entities will undoubtedly
          become. Butimagine being able to create artificial lifeforms simply by willing
          them intoexistence. This is what can be achieved on the other dimensions, as
          we haveseen in a chapter’ with the alien community who created their staff in
          thisfashion, and even a whole harem of willing concubines.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a fascinating subject which will no doubt interest a great
          manyout-of-body travelers and those people on the verge of leaving
          thisdimension permanently and who may be looking forward to taking upresidence
          in the next world.
        </p>
        <p>26 Settlers on another Planet - Page 136</p>
        <p>
          Like the man of the settlers who created his secret cave with dozens ofloving
          and complying women fulfilling his every desire. Though many of usmay take
          exception to this on the grounds of morality, the next world willoffer
          infinite opportunity for the most outrageous imaginations to fulfill
          theirwildest dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point it may make sense to explain the true nature of suchmanmade
          artificial entities. What are they made from? And what keeps themalive?
        </p>
        <p>
          As anybody who has ever written a story or a novel will tell you soonafter
          they have created a character it will develop its own personality. But it’snot
          just authors or actors who create artificial entities that are given a
          spiritby the creator: everybody is doing it all the time in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, we imagine what another person is like whom we barely knowand we tend
          to fill our lack of knowledge by weaving a personality aroundthem. This
          personality, of course, is our own projection. How often do wefind ourselves
          surprised that the person turns out to be quite different fromhow we imagined
          them to be?
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, we cannot see them in this world, but on the next dimension.they
          are real, and instead of talking to the real person we address our
          fantasy(unless the real person is a powerful enough force to pierce this
          fantasy). Wefeed them with our thought power and keep them alive for as long
          as wemaintain our attention on them. The moment we withdraw our attention,they
          fade into the matter of that plane and are reconstituted when calleupon.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the appearance of these entities is a reflection of the thoughwishes,
          emotions and affections of their creator. The many beautiful ladiethe settler
          created for his harem were a reflection of his devotion and love forthem and
          sexual desire. They looked extremely beautiful and developed theirown
          personalities, They interacted not only with their creator, but with eachother
          and when I met them they even interacted with me and it was hard totell
          whether they were real or imagined. The same was true of the other staff- the
          chauffeurs, butlers and maids. To me, as an outsider, they appeared likeflesh
          and blood people.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has to be pointed out that this applies in a positive as well as in
          anegative sense. On the few occasions that I have visited the lower realms,
          theability to create artificial entities has had hideous consequences. Evil
          thoughtcreates evil entities. The folklore of vampires and werewolves may have
          their
        </p>
        <p>
          origin here, and these are just scratching the surface of the depths to
          whichhuman depravation can sink. I saw evil hideously contorted entities that|
          even preyed on and tormented their creator, who battled with themcontinually.
          They also attacked other dwellers of those realms. Forillustration purposes we
          only have to look at the horror film genre or at someof our own nightmares to
          get the picture. They are powerless against peoplewho have no link to these
          type of vibrations and even if we encounteredthem by accident or out of
          curiosity we would likely be invisible to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is fair to say that our planet is surrounded by a belt of negativeenergy -
          thought forms created by selfish and evil-minded people both livingand_dead.
          We have all witnessed them during nightmares, when a weakerpart of ourselves
          has opened itself up to fear, maybe from watching a horrorfilm late at night
          or being subjected to real life torment during the day. Atnight fear opens a
          sympathetic communication line which connects us to the‘demon belt’, which can
          populate our nightmares with the most hideousmonsters and events.
        </p>
        <p>
          People with powerfully positive personalities create their ownbenevolent
          artificial entities that make everybody who comes into theirProximity feel
          good. They are ready to help and reach out to anyone whoneeds them. Some
          clairvoyants refer to them as angels. They are the faithfulservants of their
          creators, who can send them to anybody who they feelwould need their help and
          their presence will release powerful beneficialenergy on the recipient no
          matter where they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not everybody creates such persistent entities. Castaneda” called them‘allies’
          in his books - powerful manifestations of sorcerers, who can alsodestroy the
          keeper if not properly controlled. All black and white magicmakes use of these
          features of the next dimension.

          For us Earth-bound citizens, they have only a very temporary
          lifespan,sometimes no more than minutes or seconds before their substance
          iswithdrawn by our fading attention.

          No doubt many readers will want to find out for themselves what it is like
          tovisit dimensions beyond the physical. As I mentioned in the book,
          followingtechniques specifically designed to reach these levels was never my
          maininterest or strength. My prime motivation was to reach higher states
          ofconsciousness via meditation. You will find there are plenty of
          websitesinterested in making money by promising quick results via their
          owntechniques. Finding ways into altered states of consciousness doesn’t have
          tocost more money than the price of a paperback. Techniques abound. Youcan't
          go far wrong by following the techniques of psychologist StephenLaBerge of
          Stanford University who made it his life's work to study luciddreams. He
          developed a number of powerful methods laid out in his bookson Lucid Dreaming.
          The most important requirements are a keen interest, thedesire to achieve,
          motivation and persistence.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in meditation there are many techniques and evenmore
          teachers. It is worth bearing in mind that the prime objective ofmediation is
          personal liberation and realisation of reality. There are many so-called gurus
          who are keen to make money or enroll you into a cult. Cults arethe opposite to
          personal freedom. You will find guidance from within onceyou start mastering
          simple meditation techniques (please refer to theRecommended Reading at the
          end of the book).
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of meditation is that it transforms your life and, like yoga, iis
          all about balance. It is better to meditate for 20 minutes twice a day
          thar.for hours at a time, which can lead to imbalance. To rely on common
          sense,gut instinct and intuition is better than following a cult or believe
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your teacher is within you. Any teacher you may encounter in thisworld or on
          the next level will only have your personal freedom andliberation at heart and
          will have no interest in turning you into a follower orselling you a belief
          system (and they usually have a great sense of humor andtend not to take
          themselves too seriously). As you unfold with meditation,your perception will
          clear, ego identification will give way to a deepappreciation of fellow life
          forms, personal freedom and a sense of anunderlying joy and ecstasy in
          everyday life. The beauty of this physicalworld is that there is no ‘magic’.
          The ‘magic’ of our physical dimension isthat the cosmos follows the perfect
          and beautiful laws of nature. The next
        </p>
        <p>
          dimension promises environments of unimaginable magic, but on closerinspection
          we will find that it is just an expansion of the perfect laws of theuniverse.
          Unhappiness is the result of not being able to embrace reality. Tosurrender
          and embrace the reality of this dimension in the present is trulyempowering
          and liberating and the source of happiness.
