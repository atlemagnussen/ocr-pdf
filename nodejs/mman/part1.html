        <h3 id="the-day">The day the world changed</h3>
        <h4>Germany, August the 14th 1975</h4>

        <p>
          It was very unusual for me to look at my mother’s garden before first saying
          hello to her on one of my rare visits. But today was different. The first
          thing I noticed was the red beech tree, which my mother had planted nearly
          twenty years earlier when we had moved into the new house. I had never
          remembered it looking quite as vigorous, so full of energy. Today it appeared
          to have a presence about it which was difficult to ignore. Charisma may be the
          wrong word, but that was what it felt like. I couldn't resist getting up very
          close and touching its bark.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a second I could have sworn I had no hands when I tried to touch it.
          They appeared to materialise out of thin air. My attention
          was devoted to admiring the strength of its sturdy trunk and the new shoots
          sprouting from the base of its roots. I was impressed by their energy and
          vitality. How could I never have noticed such life, such power?
        </p>
        <p>
          I touched the leaves. The vibrancy was such that its life forceseeped into my
          arm, which almost made me recoil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I turned away and faced the front door of my mother’shouse. My mind
          must have missed the few steps I took to get there,although I was incredibly
          lucid and alert. But it didn’t last for long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things began to spin. For a moment I felt as if I was drugged. Ibecame dizzy.
          With great effort I found my composure by focusing on
        </p>
        <p>= the grass in front of me, and clarity returned.</p>
        <p>
          But then something extraordinary happened. When I lookeddown I discovered with
          horror that had no legs. I seemed also to haveacquired a second pair of eyes
          in the back of my head which allowedme three-hundred-and-sixty-degree vision.
          Fortunately, the next time Ilooked down my body had returned - but only
          reluctantly, as if to say‘OK, if I must’.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing the mind will do under the circumstances is to finda rational
          explanation, like amputees will often insist that their limbsare still there
          because they can still feel them despite all the evidence tothe contrary. In
          my case it was the opposite: I could see them, but theyappeared to have no
          reason for being there. That, and the fact that I hadenhanced vision, tossed
          my mind into confusion and panic. Reason andcommonsense disintegrated.
          Something so extraordinary washappening to me that there was no possibility of
          a sensible explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What am I doing here? Why am I not in my bed at home next tomy wife, eighty
          miles away? How did I get here?”
        </p>
        <p>The panic was intense,</p>
        <p>
          “How am I going to get back? What will everybody think? Howam I going to
          explain it to my mother when she finds me here at six inthe morning?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I needn’t have worried. I felt a rush in my ears and suddenly Iwoke up in my
          bed next to my wife. But what was it that I had wokenup from?
        </p>
        <p>
          I grabbed Julia and shook her. “Wake up, you'll never believewhat just
          happened.”
        </p>
        <p>“What?” she said, sleep-drunk and irritated at being disturbed sorudely.</p>
        <p>
          «=p ‘Tve just been to my home town!” I said, half expecting her to sitbolt
          upright and look surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, she mumbled, “You're dreaming - go back to sleep.” Andoff she went,
          leaving me in a state of turmoil. Even at breakfast Icouldn’t quite convince
          her. She was open to all sorts of ideas, but shelooked skeptical about this
          one.
        </p>
        <p>Doubting your sanity is a hard thing to do. One moment life is normal,</p>
        <p>
          uneventful; then suddenly it falls apart. This is what people report after
          badaccidents or a sudden death. I felt that something was not right in my
          head,
        </p>
        <p>
          perhaps something medical. I went to the library before lunch and looked
          upbrain tumors in the medical section. There was nothing there that I
          couldrelate to. Next to it was the psychology section - books on dreams, on
          Freud;but there was no mention of my symptoms. Next to Psychology
          wasparapsychology and the paranormal. I was determined to work my wayfrom
          shelf to shelf in order to find answers. Finally, I read something of—
          ‘Doppelgangers’? and things began to fall into place. Had I known about~ lucid
          dreams it may have saved me some trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only when a friend recommended me to read Castaneda’s ASeparate Reality
          that the penny began slowly to drop. Castaneda described astate of mind which
          could open the doorway to another dimension, or, as hecalled it, “a separate
          reality”. I read all his books. What had been a worryingexperience had now
          become the greatest opportunity of my lif departurefrom the mundane; a break
          from the limitations of our three-dimensionalworld; the opportunity, no less,
          to enter a parallel universe. This wassomething so extraordinary that I was
          determined to find ways to repeat theexperience at all cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that year we moved to England. We lived in a caravan inBournemouth until
          we found a flat. Three months passed while I waited tostart a course in Art
          Therapy and my wife waited to start one in Drama. Untilthen I painted and
          drew, but I increased my meditation as well. I figured thatfive years of
          prolonged contemplation may have triggered something in mybrain may have
          specialised extra brain tissue or strengthened a ‘muscle’. Ijust knew that
          meditation had played a key role in the event of my luciddream, because I had
          had other strange experiences in the past, but none likethat.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ‘separate reality’ event in Germany was on my mind daily. InEngland,
          literature on out-of-body reports was more abundant. I read everybook I could
          find on the subject, while hoping - wishing - for anotherextraordinary
          experience and meditating daily in order to encourage itFinally, I stumbled
          upon a book by Robert Monroe called Journeys Out of theBody. It.was the break
          I needed.
        </p>
        <p>Thad to wait another four months, but then it happened.</p>

        <h4>24th December 1975</h4>
        <p>
          After waking at 8:30 am I went back to sleep.
          I spent some time in asemi-doze and then, after about an hour, Thad a vivid
          dream. I wasstanding with someone in a large round room chatting when I
          became» aware that I was dreaming, The realisation that what I had been
          hoping\y for, reading about and anticipating had come alive gave me an
          instantthrill. The knowledge that I was able to influence events in my
          dreamwas exhilarating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next moment I became vaguely aware of my body lying in bed. Inside this
          body I was strangely disconnected and felt I could= simply rise out of it.
          Maintaining my awareness while avoiding waking
        </p>
        <p>
          up in my body, I made an effort to dissociate myself from it. Isucceeded, and
          then, separated from my body, I looked around.Through the window I saw the
          sunrise. Then my vision dimmed. Ibecame unnerved. I could feel things, but my
          environment wasundefined and blurry. Not knowing how to control the situation
          Istarted chanting a meditation mantra. At that moment I began to gyrateand
          swirl while simultaneously feeling increasing joy. I had the strongdesire to
          see my new surroundings, and willing my eyes open I noticedwith disappointment
          that I had opened my physical eyes and was nowfully awake. —
        </p>

        <h3 id="looking-at-myself">Looking at myself</h3>
        <p>24th December 1975 - one hour later</p>
        <p>
          With my body still rigid if not paralysed, I closed my eyes and allowedmyself
          to drift_into_a_dream-state without losing control of myconsciousness. I knew
          that I could leave my body with an effort of will,and the way I accomplished
          this, which came instinctively, was byrolling myself out of my body and out of
          bed. Floating a foot above thefloor, I moved to the opposite corner of the
          room and from there sawmy body lying peacefully on its side in bed and
          completely unaware ofme looking at it. Then I glided back towards the bed in
          order to re-entermy body from the back, a bit like slipping into an item of
          clothing; butbefore I did so I stopped and observed with fascination the
          texture ofthe hair at the back of my head - a truly novel experience, I
          thought. Islipped back into my body via my head, but had some
          difficultyaligning myself. Finally I succeeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because I was still in my altered state, despite being back in mybody, I
          decided to take advantage and try another experiment. Withoutfurther ado I
          drifted towards the ceiling, intending to enter the flatabove us. I thought it
          would be an ingenious way of getting to knowour neighbours - we had moved into
          the flat a month ago and still hadnot made their acquaintance. As I poked my
          head into the ceiling itbecame very dark and I could not see anything at all.
          I decided toreturn to my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          As before I rolled out of my body, but this time I stood up withthe intention
          that before doing anything else I should attain full wakingconsciousness and a
          clear mind in the alternate state. This was not soeasy, as my mind oscillated
          between two states of awareness: one thedream-state, which tempted me to let
          go and drift into a commondream-world, the other the waking state with the
          body asleep, whichwas determined to resist the lure of dreams. Finally I
          triumphed oversleep and was fully awake in my sleeping body, with my
          nonphysicaleyes wide open and my vision cleared. I observed with curiosity
          thatsome of the sittingroom carpet had found its way into the bedroom,creating
          a strange new setting. This time I decided to visit ourneighbours via the
          staircase through the hall. As I walked up the stairsmy consciousness was of
          such clarity that I feared I might actually havetaken my body with me and was
          physically marching up the stairs, In
        </p>
        <p>
          order to dispel my doubts I decided to test my state by sticking myhand
          through the wooden stairs. To my horror I found resistance whereTexpected to
          pass through; to my relief, as I looked up the stairs I sawstrange furniture
          on the landing and a new red carpet, which I knewdid not exist on the physical
          level. Yet I was still so confused, so Idecided to return to my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time I had real difficulty aligning myself with my body. Myjaw did not
          fit at all and my limbs felt twisted and distorted. With panicI realised that
          I was unable to slip back into my body. I was completelyparalysed, All effort,
          all fighting was in vain. Then I recalled readingthat the best way to re-enter
          the body was to go back to sleep. InstantlyTrelaxed and surrendered to that
          familiar urge. I drifted off in a fewseconds, and moments later I found myself
          fully awake in the physicalbody. I could move my limbs. I pinched my skin.
          Everything was backto normal. I got out of bed, allowing the immensity of this
          adventuresink in,
        </p>

        <h3 id="birth-pain">Birth pain</h3>
        <h4>28th December 1975</h4>
        <p>
          Half lying, half propped up against a pillow in my
          bed, I attempted tomeditate. Soon I found myself drifting off into sleep with
          strong@ images and surreal visions. I was shaken then by a deafening roar inmy
          head. The noise was so strong that my body began to tremble.Fortunately I
          remembered having read about this kind of vibration,which was supposed to
          precede a cataleptic state - a trance-typecondition. This calmed my anxiety
          immediately, though I had neverexpected the noise to be that powerful. I
          thought it would pass soon,but instead it became stronger and stronger. My
          head started shakingy and with my teeth chattering my whole body began to ache
          and' convulse. But through the extreme discomforts I managed to keep mycool
          and persevere. I focused on rolling out of my bed leaving thebody behind, Lo
          and behold, with hardly any effort at all I floatedinto the air with the noise
          in my head ebbing away. With mynonphysical eyes I could see the outline of my
          room from a slightlyelevated position. Everything began to become more defined
          and ¥clear as I began concentrating on my perception, though my head still
        </p>
        <p>
          felt heavy, as if I was drugged or had a bad hangover. I began to feeldizzy
          and soon tumbled back into my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still could not decide what had happened to me. For all I know Icould have
          been levitating physically, but the more plausibleexplanation was that I had
          left my body. I kept my eyes closed, refusingto return to the physical level,
          and instead I decided to re-enter thesame state as before by focusing on the
          vibration. Soon the deafeningroar started to fill my head again. My body began
          to ache and shakeviolently. I forced my nonphysical eyes to focus into the
          room straightahead, where I saw strangely coloured lights hovering in the
          centre.Almost simultaneously a heavy storm began to rage right through
          theentire room, as if a hurricane had smashed the window and was nowready to
          thrash the house. I was torn between returning to my bodyand riding it out. I
          decided termination was not an option. I hadinvested too much. I opted for
          blind faith and hoped that I would notbe harmed. The prospect of the rich
          rewards of pioneering into anotherdimension underpinned my decision to go with
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again I rose above my bed into the air. I was prepared for thepowerful gust of
          wind which flung me against the wall, but I was stillalarmed by its violence
          and numbed by the impact. The noise in myhead built up to a crescendo. I held
          my nerve and decided to go thewhole way.
        </p>
        <p>
          What troubled me greatly was the fact that my body was no— longer lying in my
          bed as I had expected. I wondered whether some
        </p>
        <p>
          brain seizure had catapulted me physically out of my bed. Thedeafening sound
          and pressure in my head increased and became quiteunbearable. Something was
          pushing and pulling me at the same time. I‘was punch-drunk and on the
          borderline of losing consciousness. Thepossibility of a brain seizure appeared
          alarmingly real and the fear ofending up with brain damage overruled any
          desire to continue. I madea momentous effort to wake up.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I opened my eyes I was lying in my bed in utter peace andcalm. The
          position of my body was exactly as before, half propped upas when I fell
          asleep. Nothing at all had happened to me physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no pain, my head was clear. There was no aching, nodiscomfort.
          Instead, a gentle peace spread through my body. It was the
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          absolute opposite of what I had just been through. I got out of bedwithout any
          problems or negative after-effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was perplexed by the physicality of the experience, by the brutalityand the
          very ‘real’ nonphysical pain, of which there was no trace after I wokeup. The
          other thing I found very confusing was that my body had notappeared in bed
          where I had expected to find it as before, and yet when Iwoke up it was in
          exactly the same position as it was when I starteddreaming. Also, I had no
          idea how much time had passed. I speculated thatthe whole episode may have
          been an hallucination brought about by enteringan unknown state of mind via
          meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thad even wondered in a mad sort of way that I may have been testedby some
          supernatural forces, to see if I had the guts and stamina to enter intothe new
          universe - some kind of initiation, perhaps. I just didn’t know, butdespite
          not quite succeeding in entering the next dimension I was stillpleased with
          how close I had got.
        </p>
        <p>But what door had I opened? Was I on the edge of insanity or on the</p>
        <p>
          edge of another dimension, torn out of my customary world and hurledagainst
          the barrier dividing this world and the next?
        </p>
        <p>I would soon find out.</p>
        <p>
          For days I wondered if I had paid a physical price for the extremediscomfort I
          had felt and if there were possible negative consequences to myhealth as a
          result. This did not perturb the pursuit of my quest, however, andI began to
          feel annoyed with myself that I had chickened-out at the lastmoment. I decided
          not to be cautious the next time, but rather to be moredetermined and bold. I
          became obsessed, but I had to wait another month
        </p>
        <p>before I was able to take it to the next stage.</p>
        <p>‘Things took a rather more tranquil turn at my next out-of-body event. It</p>
        <p>
          was almost as if a heavy cocoon surrounding my body had to be piercedbefore I
          could progress. Instead of fighting to free myself from my physical
        </p>
        <p>Prison Ldiscovered a much gentler way: the waking dream, or lucid dreary)</p>
        <p>
          as it is more widely known as.Opinions are divided as to whether lucid
          dreaming is different than
        </p>
        <p>
          out-of-body projections. I believe they are the same thing. The only
          differenceone could make is that during out-of-body experiences the subject
          can seetheir physical body as they are still on the physical dimension,
          whereas lucid
        </p>
        <p>
          dreams take place in different realms altogether. I can imagine that
          thediscomforts I experienced may have been due to the fact that I was
          stillattached to the physical body, tearing against the natural union of mind
          andbody. The essence of the subtle projection body belongs to the
          nextdimension and one could argue that the two dimensions don’t mix
          naturally.A lucid dream is an awareness of one’s subtle body on its natural
          dimension.Lucid dreams are generally much more easy to control and much
          morenatural.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally during a lucid dream I was aware of what is commonlyknown as an
          umbilical cord’, made out of some luminous matter attachedbetween the subtle
          and the physical body. It originated from my stomach orthe back of my head.
          This phenomenon has been widely reported by otherexperimenters and is often a
          dead give-away for the permanent inhabitantsof the next dimensions. This in
          turn proved to me that projection and tucid’)dreaming may be the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge, though, is how to define these dimensions. Howreal are
          they and what is reality anyway? What tells us that what weexperience in the
          next dimension is not just a dream? I applied a very simpledefinition (which I
          have used throughout this book) in order to determinewhether my
          other-dimensional experience was real or not. The majority of usconsider what
          we perceive when awake as reality, which is determined bywhat enters our
          sensory faculties via vision, hearing, smelling, touching andtasting. Waking
          consciousness is considered a state of mind which allows usto be aware of our
          own existence, our identity, our environment, and otherpeople who will confirm
          our existence by acknowledging us. This reality alsoallows us the freedom to
          make choices, take action and interact with otherpeople.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use the same criteria when defining reality in the next dimension.Here too
          Iam aware of my existence, my identity and my environment, andhere too I
          interact with other people who respond to my existence. All theseexperiences
          were recorded in my journals only when they fulfilled thesecriteria and would
          be documented only when I was absolutely certain ofbeing fully awake during
          the experiences. Any lack of self-awareness orwakefulness was simply discarded
          as a dream, although I believe manydream experiences may actually be
          other-dimensional excursions without the

          I will tell later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered in the majority of cases that when lucidity arose out of adream
          the dream contents, surroundings and events changed dramatically atthe moment
          I woke up in my dream: people disappeared, scenery changed
        </p>
        <p>
          @ and the environment became clearer and more real. But at other timesnothing
          changed at all and I concluded that I was already on another level,dreamless,
          with only the state of consciousness altering. Very early on Itrained myself
          to spend a moment or two to focus my attention, until I wasone-hundred-percent
          sure that I had full waking awareness. This wasachieved by focusing either on
          my hands (a method suggested by Castaneda)or on an object in front of me.
          William Buhlman‘ suggests simply tocommand yourself “clarity now” to achieve
          the same thing. Sometimes Iwould scoop up some earth and let it run through my
          fingers, or I wouldstudy the detail of the bark on a tree. Any object close-by
          would serve untilwas satisfied that I was fully awake.

          ‘One month after my dramatic initiation into the next dimension Iexperienced
          an awakening from a dream into another world, and I could nothave wished for a
          more natural introduction to my new expanded reality.

        <h4>January 1976@</h4>
        <p>
          Following half an hour of meditation I went back to bed,
          straight tosleep and into a dream.I don’t recall the details of my dream, but
          it was vivid - so vivid= in fact that I was startled to realise I was
          dreaming. A powerful forceswept me away and almost simultaneously dropped me
          in the middleofa street that I did not recognise. The first thing I saw was a
          ten-year-old-girl in a green dress running across the street. Beyond her I saw
          anold woman looking into a shop window. There was traffic. I couldmake out a
          town square in the distance but could not identify thelocation. A moment later
          I woke up in my bed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This short but powerful event gave me a taste of things to come. I wasexcited.
          I thought that if I kept my drowsy state of mind in place and
        </p>
        <p>
          stopped myself moving around too much that I could go straight back. I
          wasright.
        </p>
        <p>m</p>
        <p>
          After drifting back into_a cosy dreamworld I found I wastraveling in a tube
          train. It felt like I was in Hamburg, but I wasn’t sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the door of the train opened and I stepped out I became awareimmediately
          that I was dreaming. The scenery hadn't changed at all,just my awareness. I
          assumed that I was already functioning on anotherdimension before becoming
          lucid. 1 stopped and focused until mysurroundings became crystalised into
          vivid reality. There was no doubt:I was fully awake and where I stood was not
          in a dream world but in asolid environment. The clarity of my state of mind
          and the realisation
        </p>
        <p>
          that I was in_another dimension exhilarated me tremendously. Ifanything, I
          felt more awake than awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          My surroundings were defined so clearly and solidly that I beganto wonder
          whether by some fluke I was actually there in my body. Mydoubts were dispelled
          simply by accomplishing a giant leap into theair. I then decided to venture
          out of the tube station to investigate mynew surroundings. I skipped up the
          stairs like an athlete withsupernatural powers until I entered bright
          daylight. I was in a citysuburb. It could have been Hamburg, but I did not
          recognise it. To myright the road passed under a railway bridge. I was
          overwhelmed bythe crispness of the event and the clarity and sharpness of
          myconsciousness. I had just started to make plans for my next excursion,and
          getting excited at the prospect of becoming a flying human being,when suddenly
          I woke up in my bed.
        </p>
        <p>Beware too much excitement, I learned: it will cut your excursionshort.</p>
        <p>Ithas been said that one of the most powerful tools to enable projection</p>
        <p>
          is a strong desire to be at a certain place or to be with someone, for
          instancethe overwhelming desire of lovers to be together.
        </p>
        <p>Very early on I discovered this desire to be a powerful and integral part</p>
        <p>of successful out-of-body journeys. Somehow our energy composition, when</p>
        <p>
          freed from the physical body, is much more closely related to the energy
          ofemotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tn my case it was the fact that I had left my home town in Germanyonly nine
          months earlier, which explained why I was so frequentlycompelied to go back to
          either Hamburg or Bielefeld in Germany, where Ihad studied and kept fond
          memories, or my place of birth, and where I grewup, a small quaint place near
          the Dutch border. Then it exerted a powerfulmagnetism, especially in the early
          stages with my mother, younger brotherand grandmother still living there.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘My new life in England had become more complicated and demanding.I was trying
          to build a new life with my wife in a strange town in a strangecountry. There
          were times when I felt like a fish out of water, adjusting toanother culture,
          a new language and new people. Like many people leavingtheir home country
          behind I felt like an exile, deported into an alien world,and I started to
          believe that the principal force behind my out-of-bodyprojections was a
          longing for home. I was too preoccupied adjusting to mynew life to spend any
          time attempting what I had done a month earlier, and Icame to rely on
          spontaneous forms of projection instead, driven by homesickness rather than by
          the result of my regular meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always regarded meditation to be the original trigger for
          myprojections. At the time of my first separation from my body I had
          beenmeditating intensively for many years, starting when I was a student.
          Mymotives were not to experience supernatural phenomena but to achieve adeeper
          understanding of my individual nature. Out-of-body events, howevernovel, were
          never the goal, but they were a very agreeable by-product ofmeditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I realised that my homesickness was a great source of emotionalpower with
          which to attain distant projection.

        <h4>27th January 1976</h4>
        <p>
          I had learned already that too much
          excitement could cut short theopportunity to explore my new-found freedom, so
          instead I focused ona compulsion to re-visit my mother’s house in Germany, as
          I had in my
        </p>
        <p>first experience.</p>
        <p>
          I visualised the house until it appeared clearly in my mind. In an# instant a
          powerful force picked me up and carried me at a terrific speedthrough space.
          Everything was dark, but when I focused I could seelights flashing by beneath
          me. I could also hear the wind in my earsand feel it on my face. Only seconds
          later I landed in my mother’sgarden. I stared into the lit kitchen window. My
          grandmother andmother were sitting around the kitchen table, but they
          seemedunhappy, looking rather depressed. (I later found out that mygrandmother
          was very ill at that time and that my mother was veryworried.) Then suddenly
          my mother looked up in my direction and tomy great surprise she came straight
          through the wall, greeting me with4 a familiar big hug: “I know you aren't
          here in your real body, but itdoesn’t matter,” she said.I was rather taken by
          surprise, not only by the fact that she couldsee me, but also by her insight.
          Through her strong and warm embraceI could feel her powerful emotion. I knew
          instantly that the reason forher greeting me like this could only have been
          that she was dreaming. I‘was tempted to suggest to her that she should realise
          that she wasdreaming or make an effort to recall our meeting so that I could
          ringher up and confirm it, but it was too late. I was pulled away suddenlyand
          woke up in my bed in Bournemouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I pondered this short episode it became very clear to me howeasy and
          natural it would be for people to meet on the next dimension, evenif we lived
          hundreds of miles apart - even if we were separated by physical death -if we
          were all to develop the power of conscious dreaming. Everything aboutthis
          encounter was very authentic. The fact that we cannot escape ourproblems in
          life, like my grandmother's illness, and carry them over into thenext
          dimension, was also very clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the following months I made visits to Germany and otherplaces with
          great regularity, and each time I learned a little more. I was stilltrying to
          come to terms with the nature of the dimensionality and how otherpeople's
          dreams interacted with my excursions.

        <h4>27th April 1976</h4>
        <p>
          In early moming I got up briefly to use the toilet then went
          back to bedagain. I meditated for_a few minutes by focusing on my third eye’,
          but I
        </p>
        <p>
          ecouldn’t hold my attention and slid_into sleep with vivid dreams. Theybecame
          increasingly lucid until I had full waking awareness. Unfortunately J
        </p>
        <p>only recalled two experiences when I woke up.</p>
        <p>
          After a short excursion around the house I decided to leavethrough the bedroom
          window. I paid little attention to mysurroundings and decided to travel to my
          hometown in Germany. ASbefore I pictured the front of my mother’s house and
          within two orthree seconds it appeared before me in its full ‘physical’ glory.
          Ifocussed on every detail, so as to enhance my wakefulness. Everythingbecame
          extraordinarily crisp and sharp. The power of my vision wassuperb.
        </p>
        <p>“If only I could see like this in real life,” I thought to myself.</p>
        <p>
          Despite this clarity there were slight inconsistencies in the way Iremembered
          it from my physical state. In the attic there was now ahuge window which
          appeared to be the room of my younger brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew immediately that I was in the second dimensionalcounterpart of the
          physical plane. The next moment my mother’s dog,came bounding towards me,
          wagging its tail, barking. I gave him a fewstrokes and he disappeared into the
          house. Moments later my mothercame out. She was emotional and excited when she
          saw me. I wasagain surprised that she could see me and I stepped back,
          momentarilyanxious that I'd frightened her by my unexpected appearance.
          Ishouldn’t have worried. As always when we met, she gave me herfamiliar
          affectionate hug and told me that I should say hello to myyounger brother. I
          went straight from the outside garden into his room;not even using the stairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brother was sitting on his bed in his pyjamas. He got up,embraced me and
          gave me a cheerful smile. I was aware of theunderlying emotional signature of
          our family’s hugs, which I had never
        </p>

          situated at the pineal gland
        </p>
        <p>
          noticed before in real life. On this level everything emotional felt
          moreintense, more authentic.
        </p>
        <p>
          informed him that I had made a deliberate effort to come here inmy out-of-body
          state and that this was not a dream - that what we wereexperiencing was as
          real, if not more so, as real life. This meant nothingto him and instead he
          distracted me by starting a conversation in whichhe mentioned something about
          two cards. Before I could ask him whathe meant I felt a strong pull from my
          body back in England. There washardly a break in consciousness when I opened
          my physical eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that neither my brother nor my mother would have been awareof the
          experience and I wondered whether they might have experienced thisas a dream,
          but when I spoke to them later neither knew anything of it. Idoubted whether
          they would even have regarded it as a dream worthremembering, which is why I
          never bothered to find out about it in thefuture. Yet I was certain that what
          had happened had actually taken place onthe super-dimensional counterpart of
          the physical Earth - as certain as if Ihad met them in the ‘real world’,
        </p>
        <p>
          To me it made sense that the next dimension from the physical universewas a
          reality. It was a carbon copy of everything that existed in this
          physicaldimension, modified by dreams, thoughts and wishes of the inhabitants,
          whoshared the physical world in the day and the nonphysical at night and
          intheir thoughts. There was a clear link between the two dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          T also noticed over time that no matter how dramatically a place mayhave
          changed or been distorted on the next dimension it was still possible,with
          relative ease, to identify it simply by reading its atmogphere. The abilityto
          read an atmosphere, thought or a feeling was many times more acute thanon the
          physical level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much later, I confirmed the existence of this link when I visited a
          higherdimension where people's ‘physical’ characteristics had changed
          beyondrecognition. It pointed to the fact that any physical object, including
          us, had acounter-dimensional aspect on every level, layered like the skins of
          an onion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth pointing out that while getting more confident I sought waysof
          confirming the reality of these experiences. To do this I asked my brotherin
          Germany to pin_a word on his wall, which I would read when projectingto the
          house next and then confirm it via phone. A few nights went buy and
        </p>
        <p>
          then I succeeded in leaving my body. As I projected into his room I
          wasconfused by the large number of notices stuck to his wall. I couldn't
          focuslarly on many of them, but one stood out and it read:
        </p>
        <p>“4 o'clock, Thursday, take car to MOT”</p>
        <p>
          I phoned my brother the following day and he told that he had onlypinned one
          word to the wall and it read simply “love”. However, he told methat he had a
          note in his diary to have his car checked in for an MOT thatfollowing
          Thursday, at 4 o'clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milling it over in my mind, I concluded that, on the next level, mindcontent
          is projected as a ‘physical’ reality and instead of remaining in thehead or in
          the diary, it is out in the open and becomes part of the otherdimensional
          environment.

        <h4>27th and 28th February 1976</h4>
        <p>
          This was the first time I succeeded in
          intentionally leaving my body to traveldirectly into the next dimension. It
          was almost too easy. I felt I was on thethreshold of a new existence. This was
          the first indication that I was about toembark on my journey as a true
          inter-dimensional traveller.In the space of two days I was able to accomplish
          this feat no feweri than four times simply by lying on my back after a good
          night's sleep andfocusing on my pineal gland in the centre of my head. It was
          so simple thatmy imagination ran wild thinking about the possibilities that
          lay open beforeme. The prospect of such unlimited freedom in deciding to
          travel to anyplace in the world - indeed anywhere in this universe - made me
          feel as if Ihad won the most valuable prize one could ever dream of.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the Philosopher's Stone, and it was not some fanciful dream.It was
          too grand, too overwhelming to comprehend in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p>
          These results were brought about during meditation. It felt as if mymind was
          split. One part of me was asleep and dealing with vague dream >images while
          another part was wide awake. J
        </p>
        <p>
          As I dealt with some dream sequences in the back of my mind, IL noticed that I
          could see my room through my closed eyelids. Althoughclearly fully awake,
          [felt a strange detachment from my body. All I had
        </p>
        <p>
          to do now was rise out of my body while making sure to remain seated.It was
          not difficult at all. Unfortunately it didn’t last very long: to
          mydisappointment, instead of opening my subtle eyes I opened myphysical ones.
        </p>
        <p>After intensifying my focus on the centre of my head I soon</p>
        <p>
          entered a heavy trance state. Still sitting upright in my bed, meditating,I
          could see the quilt cover through my closed eyes. This told me that Icould
          take the experiment a step further. To my great surprise, andbefore I could
          even make any decision, a powerful force grabbed holdof me and swept me away
          with astonishing speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While traveling through an enormous black tunnel I decided itwas time to take
          charge of the situation rather than be carried blindlyaway by an unknown
          force. I visualised an area of beach nearBournemouth Pier where I used to go
          swimming nearly every day inthe hot summer the previous year, which was not
          too far from wherewe lived. I soon saw the beach underneath me, but I overshot
          it by abetmiles. Slightly alarmed at my lack of control, I felt a strong pull
          at theback of my head. I tried to ignore it at first, urging myself to resist
          it,but my concentration faltered and I was forced back into my bodywithin
          seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day I had two similar experiences. This time I decidednot to take
          charge of the event, but allow the force, whatever it was, totake control and
          deposit me wherever it deemed fit, putting my trustinto the benevolent
          workings of nature. As before, the first experiencewas very short-lived.
          Almost as soon as I lifted out of my body I awoke @physically. It took me
          another forty minutes to reach the trance state 6again. Then I was lifted
          gently out of my body. Waiting for the force totake me away, I floated gently
          to the opposite side of the bedroom. Ilooked out of the window and stared at
          the wall of our neighbour'shouse, Then suddenly, without warning, I was picked
          up and withaccelerating speed I was pulled downwards towards the interior of
          theEarth. The direction did not change, but the speed increased and it
          wasblack as night. I could no longer be sure whether it was wise to entrustmy
          fate to the forces of nature. Instinctively, I associated goingdownwards into
          the darkness with descending into an unpleasantrealm. Images of an imagined
          Hell sprung into my mind and this

        <p>
          slowed down my speed instantly. I felt a pull at the back of my headand awoke
          in my bed.

        <p>
          The following morning, adopting the same technique and{ focusing on the pineal
          gland, I found myself pulled towards my old artschool in Hamburg, where I had
          studied four years before.
        </p>
        <p>Finally Ihad broken firmly into the next dimension.</p>
        <p>
          The unmistakable atmosphere of the art academy was there, butthe layout had
          changed dramatically. Instead of one flight of stairs inthe entrance hall
          there were now two grand sweeps leading up througha lofty three-storey atrium.
          The large windows were still there but nowthey covered three floors and were
          crafted beautifully from stainedBlass. This was not just some dream image, a
          modified physicalstructure - this was a fourth-dimensional structure inhabited
          by dead
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘© people who had taken permanent residence here, Wandering throughthe
          studios, I was greeted by students busy with their work andsmiling at me,
          somehow knowing that I was just a temporary visitor.The work of the students
          was not what they would have produced onEarth. They used materials totally
          alien to me. They were very muchengrossed in their work: most of them paid
          little attention to mewhatsoever. What made it so remarkable was the
          physicality of thework, the solidity of the building and the random details of
          the objectsbeing used and the tools lying around.
        </p>
        <p>
          I met professors I did not recognise, who returned my greetings.‘To my
          surprise I came across a large studio with my own work: hugecanvasses, all
          abstract, being prepared for an exhibition. Withfascination I studied each
          canvas, each one familiar and yet they werenothing like the work I was
          accustomed to, which was at that timeautomotive abstract pencil drawings and
          watercolour washes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were piles of unfinished canvasses as well. With my criticaleye I found
          to my dismay that most of them were lacking in qualityand direction and needed
          work. Nevertheless I was impressed by theamount of labour that had gone into
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my retum I pondered whether breaking off the Universitycourse had left this
          work unfinished or whether a part of me visitedthis school at night when I was
          unconscious and in deep sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my return I sat still in my bed and hung on to my splitawareness. I decided
          to make a further excursion, but failed to impress

        <p>
          my brain with the events and consequently have only fragments ofmemories, like
          moving through gardens or walking along strangeroads within strange cities not
          of this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This taught me the importance of impressing the brain beforereturning to
          normal wakefulness. =

        <h4>15th April 1976</h4>
        <p>
          In my dream I was locked inside a room and being chased by a knife-wielding
          maniac. There were no doors or windows and the only wayout was through the
          ceiling. The absurdity of the situation was enoughto make me realise that I
          was having a dream. As soon as I becameaware of this the maniac simply
          vanished and I floated towards the
        </p>
        <p>
          © ceiling and straight through it and found myself outside. Where Iwould have
          expected a rooftop I found myself instead crawling out of ahole into a wide
          open landscape. The realisation of being conscious in
        </p>
        <p>
          — another world never ceased to be exhilarating My wakingconsciousness became
          crystal clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time I resolved not to waste the opportunity and decided toconduct an
          experiment in locomotion. Traveling by focusing on adestination was my first
          task.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew the easiest way was to follow the force of attraction andfocus on the
          well-tried kitchen window of my mother’s house.Traveling on this dimension was
          made much easier by desire and habit.
        </p>
        <p>
          @ Desire was the fuel, and habit was the engine: it was much easier thanusing
          thought alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind I raced through the air at an unbelievablevelocity.
          Curiously, and without being able to explain why, I travelledfeet first. When
          my feet touched the ground and I rose into a verticalposition, I realised how
          short the journey actually was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as in my very first experience I saw not only the kitchenwindow but also
          had a three-hundred-and-sixty degree view aroundwhere I stood, I could see all
          the houses of the neighbourhood clearly. Istruggled to keep my balance; I felt
          like a child taking my first steps.Simply by focusing on the brick wall before
          me | intensified my wakingconsciousness and my control was restored. =~
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been chased out of a dream by a knife-wielding maniac,then arriving on
          the green fields of a different dimension after goingthrough the ceiling of a
          large building, then looking into the kitchenwindow of my mother’s house with
          a sobriety and clear mindednesswhich could be found rarely in normal life,
          this whole episode seemedto be the strangest experience imaginable. Yet it
          felt so real and normalthat I began to wonder what normality actually was.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind I walked around the outside of our house, but Ifound no-one.
          The garden and everything about it felt strangelyphysical in as much as I
          could detect none of the weird distortedfeatures taken from the dreams or
          fantasies from the next nonphysicaldimension I had noticed before. When I
          again reached the kitchenwindow in front of the house I looked inside and saw
          my motherstanding in the room, putting on her coat and getting ready to go
          towork. In mid movement she stopped and looked in my direction. I wasstartled
          and unsure whether she had seen me, I was concerned not toalarm her with my
          sudden apparition. Instead my mother relaxed andgave me a warm smile. I was
          unable to determine whether she hadseen me or simply thought of me. Then she
          turned and left the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increasingly, and annoyingly, my attention was diverted to myfeet and I
          struggled to keep my balance. Eventually I decided it wastime to leave. The
          quickest way was by willing open my physical eyes }back in England. The return
          was swift.

        <h4>27th May 1976</h4>
        <p>
          After a few more not very memorable or noteworthy excursions
          Ibecame lucid again, standing in what I thought to be my mother’shouse.
          Somehow, though, it looked unfamiliar, because the roomsappeared to have been
          rearranged. It was dark and I found toys strewnuntidily across the room.
          Generally, it looked very messy.
        </p>
        <p>I walked down a corridor and when I passed a mirror I stopped.</p>
        <p>To my amazement I could not see my reflection. I came to a flight of</p>
        <p>
          stairs which went down to the ground floor. There I met my mother,her dog and
          my grandmother. There was something strange aboutthem. Somehow they didn’t
          match the people I knew. The dog's furwas much lighter and his face looked
          strange. I concluded that I had
        </p>
        <p>
          —met apparitions and not real people at all. Had I conjured up dream-images
          simply by expecting them?
        </p>
        <p>
          When I paid no further attention to them the apparitions justdisappeared from
          the scene. I wanted to get out so I walked into anempty room towards the
          window, but I felt at a loss as how to open it.Being in a nonphysical
          environment I thought it should just be a simplematter of willing my way
          through the glass with ease. I was wrong. AsI pressed with all my force
          against the window pane the only thing Inoticed was that the glass did not
          break but bent outwards like a thickplastic sheet. I made another effort to
          pass through and I pushed thepane out nearly a foot until it disintegrated
          into small droplets. As I
        </p>
        <p>
          ] passed through it closed again behind me. (This was an experiencewhich I
          encountered later on a number of occasions when trying topass through a closed
          window.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I then found myself standing in a rather drab garden and alsonoticed to my
          annoyance that my sight had become blurred. To regainfull awareness I bent
          down and concentrated on a rather lonely floweruntil I could distinguish every
          detail clearly. The flower lookedsomewhat sad. It was a tulip which had long
          passed its full bloom andwhen I looked around I noticed that this dimension
          was a drab anddusky place, lonely and neglected. The atmosphere was
          alienating,bordering on sinister. It was not a place I would choose to hang
          out, Ithought. I walked around the outside of the house and decided to try
          totake off into flight to investigate the region in more detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took to the air but not without difficulty, and I needed toconcentrate to
          keep airborne. I made slow progress, following the road,which I knew
          instinctively would lead me to my old home town.Somehow I felt that this was a
          counterpart, a copy of my birthplace in =Germany, which I identified by the
          atmosphere rather than thelandmarks. Whatever it was, it was not a very
          inviting place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Struggling to maintain my flight, I considered various techniquesthat might
          take less effort than what I was engaged in. The first thingthat sprang to
          mind was to attempt swimming movements like the
        </p>
        <p>
          breaststroke. It wasn’t much better. Then I tried pressing my arms
          tightagainst my body and moved my feet like flippers. After this I used myarms
          and legs together, flapping like an injured crow. I thought howamusing it must
          have looked to other people who saw me flying pastlike an oversized pantomime
          bird. Eventually my effort seem to pay offand I gained in height, but oddly to
          a maximum of only about fivemeters above ground level. It was almost as if
          there was a gravitationalpull which needed effort to be overcome. I couldn’t
          maintain elevationand sank down like a doomed plane hovering just inches above
          theground. Frustrated and with a sheer effort of will and concentration Ishot
          forward and up, but soon after ended up at ground level again.Suddenly,
          without warning, somebody grabbed my feet and pushedme hard. Before I knew it
          I was catapulted into the air and I shot alongthe street. At the same time I
          was aware of a rather amused chucklefrom some invisible entity or person who
          had taken pity on me andhad provided the extra lift. I was not on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The new boost of energy enabled me to float easily along the roadat a
          constant height of about ten meters. I overtook a young girl. Tryingnot to
          frighten her I soared higher up into the air. Another welcomepush and a boost
          of energy gave me a fantastic lift and allowed me toindulge in some
          magnificent aerobatics. I dived down towards theground, picking a flower in
          mid-flight before soaring like an eagle intothe air. It was exhilarating. 1
          could not see the kind soul who hadsupplied me with the lift, but I was
          grateful. Unfortunately I nevermade it into the town. An irresistible pull
          made me wake up in my bed.

        <h4>26th November 1976</h4>
        <p>
          I hadn't had an out-of-body experience for several months and I was beginning
          to believe that my novel way of living in an alternate universe had been sealed
          off. But after waking at about three o’clock‘one morning I went back to sleep
          and almost immediately had a lucid dream. I can’t remember what triggered it
          but I found myself standingin an open area, almost derelict, a place too
          boring for words. I focused my attention until I achieved full waking
          consciousness. Because therewas nothing of any interest, lacking any better
          ideas, I thought it wouldbe fun to visit my mother’s house in Germany again. I
          imagined thetable in her kitchen and without delay I shot into the air and
          gatheredspeed quickly. For some reason the sensation dissolved and instead
          of finding myself at the desired destination I was back at my starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried again. This time I remembered that a sure way of getting about was to
          utilize the feeling of desire. I wanted to be in my hometown and I remembered
          clearly the kitchen table and the corner bench.I visualised myself lying on
          the bench and staring at the edge of thetable. The image was crystal clear,
          much more so than when visualisingit in physical life. With that I felt the
          powerful rush of high speed traveland a moment later I appeared in my mother’s
          kitchen some eight-hundred miles away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The house was empty. So I decided to take a stroll down thefamiliar road to
          visit my home town. I reasoned that this way ofmovement would be too slow and
          I feared I might wake up back inBournemouth before I had taken full advantage
          of this relatively rareexperience. I decided to take to the air. I lifted up
          to a level of abouttwenty feet and adopted a moderate running speed. I needed
          a certainamount of focus and concentration to maintain height and speed,
          buteventually I came to a halt in my aunt's old flat, which she hadoccupied as
          a refugee after the Second World War. It was a dark, dampand smelly place,
          just how I remembered it from my childhood. It wasalmost like traveling back
          in time. The flat was hemmed in by twohouses so hardly any light came through
          the window, and Iremembered that the lightbulb was on permanently as a result.
          It wasvery dank and depressing. It all streamed back from my childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the same furniture and decorations were there: the old red sofa,the 1950s
          radio, the damp, patchy wallpaper. I knew that my aunt andher family had long
          moved into a comfortable brand-new house with agarden and what I was visiting
          was a relic from the past, a badmemory, engraved permanently and solidly into
          the matter of thisdimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided it was time to leave. Outside I lifted into the air easilybut
          remained only just above the ground. I noticed two little girlspointing at me
          and chasing after me screeching excitedly as if they hadnever seen anyone
          flying before. One of them even caught my foot,yelling and laughing. I began
          to feel irritated and made a determinedeffort to rise higher and increase my
          speed, which seemed to work.Aiming to return to my mother’s house, I passed my
          old local cinema. Iwas intrigued that it was exactly how I remembered it from
          mychildhood, including the old film posters as I remembered them in thedisplay
          boxes with the still photographs of the movie showingcurrently. Curiously, I
          saw the head of the fifties German film starRomy Schneider, but with her head
          stuck perversely on a male body. Itried to read the film title on the poster
          so I could confirm with mybrother the tile of the film when I returned to my
          body, but it seemed to
          change every time I took note. Then I remembered that in reality the cinema
          had long been decommissioned and been turned into asupermarket. I pondered how
          the power of memory was able to havesuch a potent effect on the ‘physical’
          reality of this dimension. This wasa world where individual memory and
          objective reality, if there is sucha thing, had an equal claim to existence.
          Imagination was notdiscriminated against in favour of physical reality as on
          our wakingEarth,
        </p>
        <p>
          Disconcerted by the implications of this realisation, I proceededtowards the
          relatively safe endeavour of locating my family. As soon asI was airborne
          again I spotted a woman in her early twenties walking‘on the opposite side of
          the road. I recognised her immediately. It wasmy mother. I rushed over to her
          laughing. She was extremely pleasedto see me and gave me the same warm and
          familiar hug. We were bothhappy to be united and I marveled at how young and
          beautiful shelooked. She asked me how I was and whether Julia and I were
          happytogether. Instead of answering her I suddenly burst into tears with love
        </p>
        <p>
          and affection for Julia. The emotion was so powerful that I laughed andcried
          at the same time. The mixture of feelings of seeing my mother andexperiencing
          the powerful bond with my wife made me sobuncontrollably. My mother smiled
          broadly and took me into her arms,rocking me gently from side to side,
          laughing softly to comfort me asshe did when I was upset as a child. This
          powerful emotion had the -effect of waking me up in my bed. Strangely, there
          was not even a traceof the emotion I had felt just a moment ago. SI

        <h4>4th October 1977</h4>
        <p>
          At this time of our lives, Julia was doing a drama course at college while
          Iwas trying to get a diploma as an art therapist. We had different
          schedules,which would sometimes allow me to devote extra time to meditation in
          themorning. When I became drowsy I simply allowed myself to fall asleep,
          =which tended to heighten the chances of my becoming conscious in
          anotherdimension. On one occasion I noticed during meditation that I was on
          theverge of detaching myself from my body, but rather than doing that
          Isurrendered to the much more powerful urge of allowing myself to fall
          {asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the dreams that followed I was aware almost constantlythat I was
          dreaming, yet the dream images hung like treacle around mybrain and I was
          unable to shake myself free. Finally, with a great
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘= willpower, I forced myself to examine my hands to establish clarity andfull
          waking consciousness until my hand became distinct. Again, myhand looked
          rather pathetic, like the hand of a child, almost fake, but itdid the trick.
          The heavy draining dreams had left.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I looked around I was in a semicircular room with longwindows on the
          round side and a long seat underneath them following,the curves of the room.
          Then I spotted Julia, sitting there quietly,unaware of my presence and lost in
          thought. My initial thought wasthat she was an image I had projected
          unconsciously, because I knewthat at this time she was at college and that it
          could not possibly havebeen her dream-self.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't resist getting closer to her and she looked extremelybeautiful,
          ethereal, like a being from a magical kingdom. I lifted herchin with my right
          hand and made her look at me. It was as if she wasina dream. I encouraged her
          to wake up. Instead she became strangely
        </p>
        <p>
          e-anxious 0 I took her in my arms and hugged her. She was extremelylight to
          hold. I felt a powerful love and tenderness towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          While holding her I remembered that the previous evening shehad returned from
          college rather late and I had had no means ofcontacting her to make sure she
          was alright.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time I knew very little about the phenomena I had encountered.Only
          many years later did I learn about artificial entities - thought forms that
        </p>
        <p>
          manifest in the shape of our emotional concerns. At that time I didn’t know
        </p>
        <p>
          what the apparition of Julia meant and knew only vaguely that she was a@
          projection. As I learned later, artificial entities can pop up in the
          nextdimension wherever strong directive emotions are at work that don’t
          resolvethemselves. They also populate our dreams, and they can appear very
          real.They are fashioned spontaneously from the extremely responsive matter
          ofthe dimension. That does not mean that they are rampant, and they
          areidentified easily by their strange remoteness. But they don’t have to be
          likethis: depending on the power of the person who evoked them they can=
          appear very real and with a will and even a personality of their own.

        <h3 id="meeting-dreamers">Meeting dreamers in a beautiful dream</h3>
        <h4>1st October 1977</h4>
        <p>
          woke up from a dream in my bedroom, but it was not my bedroom.
          Iwalked to the window and looked over a snowy landscape, which Ithought was
          incongruous to this time of year. This told me instantlycot I was in a dream
          and it catapulted me into full wakingconsciousness. Upon seeing me a deer ran
          away from the house anddisappeared into the distance, leaving tiny hoof prints
          behind in thesnow. I climbed out of the window. Not being able to make up
          mymind where to go or what to do I used the surrender technique to seewhether
          some unknown force would take me somewhere. I was pickedup immediately by a
          current and tossed into the air like a leaf. After a
        </p>
        <p>
          gentle ascent I plunged back down suddenly and into the Earth until itbecame
          pitch black. Although it wasn’t unpleasant, I didn’t like the
        </p>
        <p>= prospect of being underground and in an instant I found myself rising</p>
        <p>Ry</p>
        <p>
          up again into a blue sky. Making a conscious effort to take charge of
          mydestination plunged me back into the Earth again so I decided to wakeup.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I opened my eyes I was lying on a sofa. I felt I could haveanother try at
          leaving my body simply by closing my eyes again, butthen I realised that
          neither the sofa nor the room were familiar to me atall. I was in a strange
          place. I had experienced what is known as a falseawakening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of just getting up and continuing with my out-of-bodyexperience I
          closed my eyes again and a few seconds later, when Iopened them, I was in a
          different room with a window. It seemed to bethe right decision because I felt
          instantly that I was in a much higherdimension than the false awakening. When
          I walked to the window Ilooked out into a lovingly designed summer garden
          bursting withmagnificent, vibrantly coloured flowers - some huge, as tall as a
          person.The greens were so soft that it sent a thrill through my whole
          body.Without any hesitation I jumped through the window. Standing amongthe
          flowers on a small winding path, I felt soft warm rain falling downto earth.
          On closer inspection I noticed that it was not wet; it was notlike rain at
          all, and when I looked up I saw the drops or flakes orwhatever they were
          falling from a grey-lilac cloud, vibrating andshimmering in cascades of
          different hues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect was such that it felt like a blessing was raining downupon me and
          sanctifying the ground. In the same way that flowers inan Earthly garden are
          invigorated by rain, I too felt invigorated, butwhat was even more thrilling
          was the fact that there was something upthere and it seemed to care about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a different world altogether. Often, other dimensionalenvironments
          appeared to be more or less copies of the Earth. Here, theflowers had an
          essential power and vitality that made me feel that theyewere at the very
          essence of worldly plants, which were only paleoreflections of these and could
          never reach such exuberance of self-expression.
        </p>
        <p>After I left the garden I came into a street. Some strange looking</p>
        <p>vehicles went past without any identifiable form of propulsion. A man</p>
        <p>
          = passed by on a bicycle and looking at me as if I had arrived fromanother
          planet, which to all intents and purposes I had.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few hundred yards further on I bumped into a couple andasked them if they
          could tell me where I was. The woman burst outlaughing and pointed at me
          saying that she did not meet people intheir dressing gown very often. To my
          astonishment I realised that Iwas indeed in my dressing gown, and I was
          wearing slippers as well.Her partner grinned brightly at me. I felt
          embarrassed and made apowerful effort of will to change my attire only to find
          that they wereboth doubled over with laughter and when I looked at myself
          again Isaw that I was stark naked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resigning myself to the fact that I had no influence over my looksI decided to
          let go of my embarrassments and instead to enjoy thebeautiful day. The couple
          finally introduced themselves and told methey were Mr. and Mrs. Peterson and
          that they lived in Surrey. Ipersuaded them to give me their address so I could
          check it out on myreturn, but our conversation was interrupted when other
          members oftheir family appeared on the scene. One of them was introduced to
          meas Michael. From that moment the attention of the group started tofocus on
          other things; their awareness appeared to be slipping awayinto some kind of
          thought or dream world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more I tried to catch the attention of the woman by tappingon her
          shoulder. “Try not to see this as a dream,” I said. “This is real.Wake up. You
          can do whatever you wish.” She smiled at me, but Iknew she had already drifted
          away into her own dream world. I gaveher a gentle kiss on the cheek and said
          good-bye. Then shedisappeared, following her husband who had already walked on
          withthe other members of their family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alter returning to physical consciousness I kept my eyes shut andran through
          what I had just witnessed in order to impress it on mybrain. At the same time
          I became aware again of my mother’s houseand saw her husband sitting at the
          table drinking coffee while hearingin the background a Beatles song coming
          from the radio. For a momentI pondered whether I should return, but I decided
          to wake up. When Ilooked around I realised the furniture in the room had been
          moved and
        </p>
        <p>
          the window was in a different position. It was another false awakening.Then I
          heard music again. It came from the radio in our bedroom andwhen I finally
          opened my eyes Julia handed me a ‘real’ cup of tea andtold me it was time to
          get up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around that time the opportunities for visiting other dimensions camehard and
          fast. There was almost an expectation before I went to sleep at nightthat I
          could travel into other dimensions simply by closing my eyes. Onoccasion I
          took liberties by visiting the places which appealed most to mewith their
          fantastic sceneries. I would conjure up a glass sphere as a means oftransport
          and drift like a soap bubble over endless stretches of paradise. Attimes I
          even abandoned my waking consciousness and allowed myself to be 7taken away
          into dream, ending up with no recollection of the events I hadwitnessed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how-to-be-a-ghost">How to be a ghost and an hallucination</h3>
        <h4>5th November 1978</h4>
        <p>
          Many times I found myself in a situation where I wasn’t sure whether I
          wasdealing with real people on the physical dimension to whom I appeared as
          aghost or people in the parallel world who also were not fully aware of my
          Jpresence and were spooked when I appeared suddenly as some form ofapparition.
          It is said that while operating on a higher dimensionalconsciousness that you
          can still experience life on the next level down - eitheron the physical level
          or on the next level down from your current one. In "?C either case the
          inhabitants would not be aware of your presence.
        </p>
        <p>In the following experience I made another strange discovery: that it is</p>
        <p>possible to dream in a dream or even to daydream in a dream.</p>
        <p>
          On one such occasion I was leaning over the banister of a smallpedestrian
          bridge over a small stream. I was fascinated by the sound ofthe running water
          and watched with fascination the ripples of thewaves. Lwas daydreaming, lost
          in my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the most curious thing happened to me: I became aware of,my situation,
          but was unable to tell whether I was in my physical bodyor in a dream. There
          was no indication that told me I was notphysically awake somewhere in Cissbury
          Park in Watford, where we
        </p>
        <p>
          lived at that time. It was only that the place was unfamiliar and that Ihad
          no_recollection of getting there that told me I was in anotherg dimension
          having a lucid dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, of course, an easy test: the flying test. If you can lift offthe
          ground you are definitely having a dream, but this didn’t occur tome for a
          moment, Instead, I focused on a small metal screw which fixeda wooden plank to
          the bridge. It was staggering how much detail Icould see. I could make out
          little scratches and minute dents on themetal and I could only conclude that
          such random marks could bethere only as a result of physical decay and
          consequently could onlyexist on Planet Earth,
        </p>
        <p>
          But the fact that I could hover above the ground made up mymind that I was
          definitely out of my body. I crossed the bridge, whichled to a scruffy
          backyard. Part of the ground was muddy and the houseat the other end look
          derelict. I was tempted to go through the housebut I found it too distracting,
          so I walked around it and along a pathwhich led to a road two hundred yards
          further on. Just then two catsjumped into my path and then ran away from me. I
          found it curiousthat they had seen me.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘As I reached the road I saw a young girl of about seven riding herbike. She
          saw me and looked rather startled and a little anxious. When.T looked down at
          myself I saw that I was dressed in a quavering andmisty white gown,
          translucent like dense fog. Seeing myself like this Ifelt anxious to calm the
          girl’s alarm in the most gentle, loving andpositive way I could muster.
        </p>
        <p>“Don’t be afraid,” said, “I am quite harmless.”</p>
        <p>“Tam a little bit scared because you look like a ghost,” she said.</p>
        <p>ay “That’s because I am a ghost, look what I can do,” I said. With</p>
        <p>a</p>
        <p>
          that I took a great leap into the air. This did not calm her anxiety.
          Shelooked very alarmed. I explained to her that this was nothing unusualand
          was in fact quite natural. I told her that she did the same thingwhen she went
          to sleep at night that she left her body and that she tooappeared like a ghost
          to people who were sensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          She seemed to understand and felt reassured. I conjured up adeep-felt
          sensation of love which I directed towards her with a greatenergy push. Her
          face lit up in a big smile and she rode off. Secondslater I woke up in my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          a”I would have given anything to hear her side of that story, if she evenhad
          one. It seemed that I was on a physical level appearing as a ghost toa —young
          girl whose senses were still open and her mind still unconditioned. Iwondered
          whether she would tell her parents that she had seen a ghost, andthen her
          parents would smile, thinking how great it was that she had such avivid
          imagination.

        <h3>Aliens</h3>
        <h4>2nd September 1978</h4>
        <p>
          I was standing in the middle of a wide open field when I becameconscious in my
          dream. A man next to me pointed towards a brightblue sky at strange flying
          shapes. My first impression was that theycould have been flying saucers. I
          wanted to make absolutely sure thatthis was not a dream and I told myself to
          be fully awake. My state ofmind couldn’t be any clearer. This was simply
          normal wakefulness, notmore, not less. Only the realisation that I was awake
          in a differentworld altogether made it something really special.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recall that before I woke up in this strange dimension the scenewas very
          much the same, even the people - further proof that althoughwe may think we
          are dreaming, we could actually have traveled intoanother dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the strange flying objects sailed peacefully across thesky at what
          I estimated to be about twenty miles per hour. I, like theothers, studied them
          with fascination. They were a white pearly colour,and they had a disk-like
          base arranged in steps getting smaller towardsthe top. The uppermost disc
          carried a square column with an onion-shaped tip. The whole object struck me
          as rather phallic and not likesomething which could easily fly under any
          physical law of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned to the man who had pointed the objects out to me andasked him who
          were flying the crafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They are women, but an alien species,” he replied. “They use allkinds of
          different flying machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision zoomed into it closely. I could make out four aliencreatures staring
          out of the large portholes, but one of them wasunmistakably human. It was a
          woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of pure curiosity I said I would be interested in boarding thespacecraft
          to talk to these strangers. I was unaware that this couldcause any danger.
        </p>
        <p>Another spectator heard me and came closer.</p>
        <p>
          “This is not a wise thing to do,” he said, “because when they takeoff it is
          unlikely that you will come back especially someone with yourattachments.”
          With that he pointed to my umbilical cord, which hunglimply from my stomach
          and disappeared into the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this I couldn't have imagined any risks and felt confidentthat all that
          was needed was an effort of will to get back into my bodyand wake up, no
          matter how far I was away from it, But now I wasn’tso sure. Despite the
          warning, curiosity prevailed and I willed myself onboard the craft. I didn’t
          quite reach it and woke up in my bed. 4
        </p>
        <p>Had I been saved?</p>

        <h3>Death rays</h3>
        <h4>11th December 1978</h4>
        <p>
          Three months later I was dreaming about alien creatures from anotherplanet.
          They were very odd-looking, quite unattractive, small andplump with a dirty
          looking dark skin. They had little heads connectedto their stunted bodies with
          hardly any neck. They appeared to havejust a single eye, or rather a visual
          organ, because it didn’t look like aneye at all. What senses they used or how
          they would perceive theirenvironment I had no idea. Their mouth and nose
          formed a singleorgan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I studied and stared at them the more vivid theexperience became and
          alll of a sudden I was wide awake in my dream.Again my wakefulness had not
          altered the events of my dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encouraged by my new-found freedom I started a conversationvia_telepathy,
          which appeared more natural than using spoken words.‘They were not unfriendly
          at all and it was easy to communicate withthem without ever uttering a
          syllable. They were quite susceptible tothought-based, nonverbal
          communication. We exchanged our views
        </p>
        <p>
          about mankind and Earth, I asked one of them about his race andwhether they
          were at a more civilised stage than us humans. He toldme that their race was
          just as ignorant and selfish as mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘There was an element of humour in his comment and it endearedhim to me. He
          convinced me that there would be no harm in.mecoming with him to visit their
          planet because I always had the optionto wake up if I didn’t find it
          agreeable. Again I detected a hint of alaugh in his comment, which made me
          chuckle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't even remember how I got there, but I knew for surethat suddenly I
          was on their home planet. There were many more ofthem now - I was surrounded
          by a whole group as we marchedtowards a large building. The architecture of
          the structure wassomething I had not encountered before, but not so unusual
          that itcould not have been thought up by humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we approached the entrance we stopped. I became aware ofsome form of
          conflict. They all stopped and started debating my arrivaland how to proceed.
          I noticed an air of suspicion being directedtowards me. I looked at the sky of
          their planet and became suddenlyamazed. Clouds drifted past, but the gaps
          between the clouds werefilled with lovely hues of colour. The beauty was such
          that it had areviving effect on my mind and I acquired a powerful state
          ofwakefulness and mental alertness.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I directed my attention to the group they were stillstanding in front of
          the great entrance to the building and still debatingwhether or not to go
          inside. I wasn’t quite sure what the fuss was allabout. I just stood there
          silently and patiently, with my face tilted to thesky, admiring the spectacle
          of ever-changing colours. Then I saw a rayof light, intensifying, sending its
          beautiful light in arcs that were gettingcloser to me - almost playfully, I
          thought. When I traced its origin Inoticed that it did not come from the sky
          at all but was cast from awindow high up in the building. I noticed that it
          was a scan raybecoming wider, scanning the area until finally it reached me.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The effect was blatantly unpleasant. The ray remained focused onme and I
          noticed its frequency changing. I felt heavy pulses comingfrom the window and
          wave after wave of colourful light. Gradually 1began to ache and when I
          noticed that my hosts had abandoned mycompany I became very alarmed and sought
          shelter in a basement
          nearby. I felt that the ray had the power to destroy me if I didn’t getout. I
          tried to get back, but my energy was sapped and I couldn’tremember how to wake
          up in my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to lift off the ground, but my flight was very unsteady, Outof despair
          I called for help. Almost instantly I felt a cocoon thrownaround me,
          protecting me, and I woke up in my bed. Once again, I hadno ill effects.

        <h4>3th of March 1980</h4>
        <p>
          I was still dreaming when I walked through my home town inGermany, but when I
          realised that I was dreaming my consciousnesssprang instantly into life with
          its customary excitement. For a moment Iwondered whether there was any good
          reason for investigating mysurroundings, but I couldn’t see any. I decided
          instead to spiritualisemy mind by trying out my new mantra, which
          _had_receivedpreviously during deep meditation. I looked up into the sky
          andrepeated the word. I used the word during normal meditation whilesitting in
          my meditation chair, but then it was hardly more thanpinning my attention to
          something to keep my mind from wandering.Here it was altogether different. The
          moment the word rolled out of mymind towards the blue sky above me I realised
          it had an overwhelmingpower. It made the whole world around me vibrate and the
          groundshake as if during a big earthquake. It felt as if a vortex had
          openedwithin the blue sky and I was being sucked into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment I considered how I could control this force andwhether I could
          use it to transport me into a distant galaxy, maybe intoanother universe
          altogether, and I focused on a single bright star whichappeared in the now
          dark indigo sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment the force weakened and dropped me back to theground. It became
          clear to me immediately that I myself had cut off thepower by my idle
          indulgence, rather than by allowing the force of themantra to take me to its
          natural domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I looked around again I found myself floating in a darkroom drifting
          towards the ceiling. A foot in front of my eyes there wasan elaborate, even
          lavish ceiling moulding. I knew immediately thatthis was the master bedroom of
          a large mansion. I had an eerie feelingof recollection. I knew this house very
          well and just by looking at theceiling I remembered every room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The house was nearly empty. Without knowing quite how, I couldsee there was a
          maid in the kitchen at the other end of the mansion,cleaning some pots. There
          were a couple of other servants, but nobodyelse. As I drifted across the room
          near the ceiling, admiring themoulded roses, I became strangely aware of some
          familiarcircumstance. Long buried memories re-entered my mind. I turedaround
          and looked down from the ceiling and saw a large bed in theroom and a person
          lying in it, breathing heavily and irregularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a very old man, spluttering and at times not breathing atall. I felt a
          faint sympathy for this corpse-like person who appeared tobe dying, and I
          wondered why nobody was by his side. Then, with asudden jolt, I recognised the
          man. It was me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was lying in bed dying, alone in a huge sumptuous mansion,deserted by
          everyone. I wondered what kind of life I had lead. I couldfeel my desperate
          loneliness. Then I noticed a thin thread attaching meto this expiring corpse.
          What was curious was that I seemed to occupythe subtle body of the dying man
          with my own subtle body. I wasaware of two people: one me dying and one me
          from the futurewatching myself. When I pondered what I must have done to end
          mylife so wretchedly, deserted by family and friends (if in that life I
          hadever had any), there emerged strange memories of a selfish life, of me
          7striving to enrich myself financially with little regard for other people.The
          result was a pile of bricks shaped into a mansion with plenty ofland
          surrounding it, but there was no real wealth in my life, onlyemptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a powerful lesson which I knew I would never have torepeat. I began
          staring into a deep black void, then remembered who Iwas now. I started to
          chant my mantra, but it had no effect other than totoss me around in the dark
          empty space. It turned me upwards andthen thrust me away again, and then it
          spat me out like a huge monsterspitting out some indigestible prey. My old
          self from a previous life
        </p>
        <p>
          clung to me like a drowning man, threatening to pull me down into
          anunimaginable hell, so he wouldn't be alone any longer. I struggled toshrug
          off this wretchedness without much success. I was sucked withirresistible
          force towards the centre of the Earth, with something like amonstrous leach
          clinging around my neck. I didn’t want to have anypart in this, but I was
          powerless to escape. If I had been dreaming itwould have been just a
          nightmare, but this was real - super real. Then Iremembered: | could still
          wake up to escape. So I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my eyes wide opened I enjoyed the relief of sitting uprightin my bed, in
          the small ten-feet-by-ten-feet bedroom of our modest 20thcentury terraced
          house. I had a young family, a wife and a child wholoved me. I had a modest
          income, but how fortunate I was, howblessed. I saw my wife asleep next to me
          and felt intense affection formy little daughter in the room next door, barely
          four months old. I wasthe happiest man in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to close my eyes and devote some quality time tomeditation. Within a
          few minutes, visions like heavy dreams began tocloud the clarity of my mind,
          For minutes I fought them off and beganto wonder whether it would be better to
          get up and make some tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to battle on and fight off the sleepiness and theimpending dreams
          which tried to get the better of me. Finally I gave upthe fight and succumbed,
          but when I woke up again it was in mydream. 1 was on_a horse charging through
          fields with other peoplearound me, hunting. I also saw scenes of a bloody
          battle two or threehundred years in the past. It was as if the spirit of my
          wretched past lifehad returned to haunt me. I didn’t want any part of this; I
          wanted out.When I awoke in my bed again I did not try to remember the details
          ofthis experience, and I was grateful that my brain blotted it out.
        </p>

        <h3 id="revolution">Revolution</h3>
        <h4>1977 (no exact date)</h4>
        <p>
          This had been an extraordinary time. I had been on work experience as
          atherapist in a psychiatric hospital. I was introduced to my supervisor, a
          ladyin her early forties, and the moment we were introduced I felt her
          icyhostility towards me. I found out later that her parents had been murdered
          ina concentration camp, and I figured that my being German was the cause of
        </p>
        <p>
          her reaction. By my mere presence I imagined I had brought to the surface
          alifetime of hurt and resentment. Her hostility was open and blatant.Everybody
          on the staff was aware of it. It manifested itself in maliciousbehaviour: she
          sabotaged my work and undermined my sessions with mypatients. As hard as I
          tried to build a dialogue with her it was impossible. Asa consequence I was
          left feeling depressed and depleted when returninghome from work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, one morning, I became suddenly aware in the most dramatic waypossible of
          the real reason for her enmity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd had a very bad night with long spells of sleeplessness while tryingto
          figure out how to appease my hostile supervisor, and finally I gave up
          anddecided to meditate. It was 4.30 am,
        </p>
        <p>
          After about an hour-and-a-half my focus went and tiredness sabotagedmy
          concentration until I fell asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost as soon as I drifted off I was jolted into wakingconsciousness. I found
          myself walking along a squelchy path with agroup of twenty or thirty people.
          The excitement that I was fully awakein another dimension was muted by the
          fact that it was raining and Ifelt the clammy chill of wet clothes on my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was most unusual. This was a physical experience. I lookedat the broadly
          knitted pattern of my woolen coat, which went down tomy knees. My legs were
          covered with handmade leather bootsdragging me along the soggy road. I felt
          uncomfortable, ill at ease. Iwas carrying a_sword in my belt with an open
          blade. I felt sick withdepression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most curious sensation was that there were two of me, theobserver and the
          observed. There was the me studying the scene andnoting down every detail,
          like the colour of my boots, the overcoat likea short blanket covering my
          shoulders and held together by a boldbrass brooch; the me peering out from
          underneath my hat into the wetlandscape, observing a troupe of people marching
          in loose formationalong the sodden mud path in driving rain. Then there was
          the otherme, experiencing the wet and the wind in my face. I carried the
          imagesof slaughter with me. I myself had slain a man in a castle we hadraided.
          I could still see the smoke from the blaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tt was just getting light. I don’t know who the person was, onlythat he
          confronted us with fear in his face. Without a thought I sunk myblade into
          him. Now I felt sick.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord of the Manor did not die an easy death. He washumiliated. I stood
          apart just watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of me was sickened by what I witnessed. His clothes weretipped from him
          and he was thrown a sack to cover himself, to fee!how the poor people dressed.
          I was the only one who could not join inand it was I he stared at - not
          pleading for his life, not begging, just fullof hatred. Whatever anyone did,
          he looked only at me. And his eyeswere telling me you will burn in hell for
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not everybody was killed. The Lord’s wife and daughters werespared, but they
          were beaten and humiliated and then driven fromtheir palace. The few things
          they packed were taken away from them.They tried to organise a couple of
          horses and a cart but the horses hadbeen killed by one of our group. The only
          thing they were left withwere the clothes they wore. Then the place was burned
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The servants were spared. “You are free,” one of our groupshouted, but the
          servants weren’t happy about it. They were furious,cursing and swearing at us.
          Even when we organised a cart with lootfrom the house and insisted that this
          was their payment for their yearsas slaves, they were not happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to deal with my discomfort by thinking about all theinjustices and
          hardships my people had suffered over the years - all thecruelty and
          exploitation. I recalled our children starving while thesepeople lived in
          luxury. I thought of our humiliation and the senselessdisregard these rich
          people held for our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thated the Lord. I hated him for making me see that however justour cause
          felt, I did not feel right about it. When I took up arms andjoined the
          peasants I did so because I felt anger at the injustice andexploitation. I was
          a young man with a respectable trade in my village.Thad no hardship and yet I
          was carried along by the emotion and thecause to restore justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Lord lay naked in his own blood with a sack thrownover him, he stared
          at me still, even though his life had gone. His hate-filled eyes still haunted
          me as our group stomped back through themud.The other part of me, the
          observer, recognised the Lord of theManor instantly: it was my supervisor at
          the hospital. They each had the
        </p>
        <p>same eyes with the same presence behind them.</p>
        <p>
          With this I sat up in my bed. There was hardly a break in consciousness.I felt
          as if I had just come in from the rain, from the muddy path, with thewet heavy
          clothes still clinging to my body. I felt sick. I felt guilty forallowing
          myself to be dragged into this madness and yet I felt I had had littlechoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          After recovering from my ordeal, I figured out what had happened. Iremembered
          at school that I had had an inexplicable fascination with aperiod of 16th
          century German history: the “Bauernkrieg”, the PeasantsRevolt, I had felt
          great sympathy for their cause - for their leader, Thomas ~Miinzer, and for
          the thousands who were put to death after the revolt failed.And now I had seen
          it at first-hand: the brutal reality in all its detail, rightdown to the
          knitting pattern of the woollen coat and the brooch on myshoulder, and the
          enemy I had brought with me over four centuries.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how-past-lives">How past lives are experienced</h3>
        <p>
          The great difference between traveling into another dimension and visiting
          aast life lies in the fact of dual consciousness. There are literally two of
          you,one the observer and the other the observed. While the observer has
          fullinsight into the observed down to the most intimate detail and is privy
          toevery thought and feeling the observed has, the observed has no
          knowledge,idea or even an inkling that they are being watched by their future
          self.Equally, the observer has no influence over the observed. What is
          fascinatingis that the past life event is not an experience like a detached
          memory orpicture, but is experienced in a here-and-now environment with the
          samereality as if it happened in ‘real life’. This throws our whole concept of
          timeand space into question.
        </p>
        <p>
          One has to be clear about the reality of the past life experience. It is nota
          dream, not a hallucination or some kind of vision. If you had an experienceof
          being a roman soldier, you would actually be that soldier, feel the armouron
          your body, talk to your mates, think about your family left behind, feel
          theground underneath your feet, all in glorious reality with a sense of
          thepresent indistinguishable from any time you spend in this life, here, now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experiencing a past life while out of the body is the closest man will getto
          real time travel. Can he influence events? No he can’t. He is compelled togo
          along with the decisions he made no matter how wrong they feel. Theobserver
          has no power, but he has the privilege or the misfortune ofparticipating in
          the life and fate of his former self in the minutest detail,down to the
          subtlest feeling or most intimate thought. Yet there is also a
        </p>
        <p>
          — strange form of detachment, which comes from the knowledge and identityof
          his real present-day self, from which he is also detached in the truest
          mostliteral sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          An authentic past life experience has nothing to do with imagination
          orsuggestion. It is a total present-day experience of self in a different body
          anddifferent time with the same feeling of self and the same awareness of
          realityas in normal waking life.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The next experience illustrates this even better, because there was
          littleeventful or emotional distraction.

        <h3 id="the-self-important">The self-important church elder</h3>
        <h4>1980 (no date)</h4>
        <p>
          When I became conscious I was walking along an aisle of a
          largecathedral. It was Christmas Eve in the year 1710. While watchingmyself
          walking along the aisle, the observer self was making a distincteffort to find
          clues as to the time and place of the event. No matter howhard I tried I could
          find no clues about the place but I saw displayed ona hymn board the numbers
          of the hymns and a date: 1710. Theobserved self offered no information.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing was sure: the church was packed - so much so that thedoors were left
          wide open and there were literally hundreds of peoplecrowding around outside.
          I was impressed by the popularity of theevent and realised that back then
          Christmas was still celebratedprimarily as a Christian event. The crowd was
          full of festive spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inoted with slight amusement the feeling of self-importance theobserved me
          held as he strutted solemnly down the aisles, checkingthat everything was
          alright and carrying a bible. I was a church elder -an official and very proud
          of it. To me this was a very important eventand my role commanded respect and
          dignity. I continued to observemyself with mirth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, when returning to my physical self in the here-now,the feeling of
          reality was still there with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, not all of my past-life experiences were like those of thepetty
          tyrant, the rebellious Killer or the self-important prig. Some of my pastlives
          would have looked splendid on any CV. In one I was on the rulingsquncil of a
          very advanced ancient civilization in South America. It couldhave been the
          Incas, Toltecs or Aztec, I never found out, but I rememberdebating a
          resolution to rid the town of the constant harassment and attacksby the
          primitive tribes lining the highway to our imperial town, which wasperched
          high up on a great mountain. The town was heavily fortified andimpregnable
          against any assault. There was a clever irrigation system, whichcould also be
          used to flood the surrounding area in front of the gates in caseof attack,
          drowning the enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people of the town experienced a privileged lifestyle, living as theydid
          in prosperity with thriving art and culture. It was felt that people fromthe
          surrounding tribes could be assimilated gradually by providing themwith menial
          employment in the servant sector, which at the same time wouldbenefit the
          citizens. I remember being the key initiator of this plan, but Ifound strong
          opposition. In the end a compromise was reached. The hiredtribes’ people had
          to wear trouser costumes to distinguish themselves fromthe rest of the city’s
          population, an idea I objected to strongly. In the end I lostthe argument and
          the discriminatory costumes were used. Predictably, thiscreated a strong sense
          of resentment in those forced to wear them, and after awhile insurgency
          erupted. The defense systems were disabled and the townwas ransacked by the
          surrounding tribes in an orchestrated attack.
        </p>
        <p>It was a horrendous blood bath and the end of a prosperous civilization.</p>
        <p>
          On another occasion I experienced my life as a respected architect incharge of
          a large town development. Unfortunately I was unable to put aname to my role.
          At another time I was the head of a tribe joining forces withan invading army
          after being threatened with annihilation. In the end Ibecame a powerful
          general within the army under the direct command of myconquerer. Again I was
          unable to identify any historical details.
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears that when entering the mind and body of a past-life self,
          yourknowledge is restricted to the here-and-now perception of the past life.
          If thepast-life character, whose body you occupy, doesn’t think about the name
          of his leader or the campaign being fought or what the year it is, you have no
          access to the information. The only time I had knowledge of the year waswhen I
          was the church elder at Christmas and spotted the year 1710 on thehymn board.

          Lam doubtful whether all these hundreds of people who claim to havebeen
          Cleopatra in their past lives, or some other famous historical figure, canbe
          taken at their word. The odds of having been an ordinary person are
          muchhigher, if less romantic,

          Everything described so far was only the beginning of my experiences - amodest
          introduction to what would follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traveling into higher dimensions had never been my priority;unlocking life's
          greatest mysteries through meditation was my goal. I amcertain that without
          meditation none of my out-of-body experiences wouldhave occurred. Although my
          out-of-body trips were never planned and Inever developed a technique to
          achieve them deliberately, I saw them as atool with which to achieve a higher
          state of consciousness. They were neverthe object of my meditation. When I
          could, I would use them to push theboundaries of my consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frequently, travels into the higher dimension came about duringmeditation
          rather than during sleep. Walking around other worlds andnoting down my
          adventures would have been a good enough past-time initself, simply because of
          the sheer pleasure of doing so. What can be moreseductive than living in a
          virtual world where you can follow your dream’sdesires to the full,
          responsible only to yourself? Well, call me a stick-in-the-mud, but roaming
          around wildly and indulging in untold pleasures hasnever been my top priority
          when in virtual wonderland. More often than notduring the experiences I have
          described, I was trying to get out of the dream,attempting to break its
          boundaries and move beyond, because pleasure, joyand ecstasy increase
          exponentially the higher you soar after leaving thisphysical Earth. Once you
          have had a sip from the spring of eternal joy, howcan you be satisfied with
          anything less, even if it combines all the worldlypleasures you can ever dream
          of? My goal was the ultimate pleasure: being

          primordialinstinct which had been with me as long as I could remember.

        <p>
          But it would have been unnatural not to indulge in curiosity and strayoff the
          path in order to get a glimpse of the grand vistas of our universe. I feltno
          guilt at my weakness. Whatever happened, it was part of the coursewhich was my
          life. The universe is too beautiful to ignore; it’s impossible notto become
          sidetracked by it. My ultimate quest for truth meant I had also tobe
          absolutely open, to accept the truth no matter how uncomfortable it was,

          metaphysical,scientific or philosophical. Reality and truth unprejudiced and a

          self-discovery. How could I have closed my eyes to a world which had begun
          toopen up to me?
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered early on that meditating while out of the body could leadto the
          most powerful experiences one could imagine, and whenever Iremembered to I
          tried to employ the technique to gain entry into new worldsand yet higher
          dimensions which lay undiscovered.
        </p>
        <p>How can you explain dry land to a creature who lives in the sea? When
          returning from such excursions I soon discovered that the human brain
          wasTot programmed to deal with such matters. It had no means of translating=—
          into language what I had experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following years I was to discover realms surpassing anything
          thegreatest fantasy writers could conceive of: beings who communicated in
          strange, non-verbal languages; sounds and songs which were used as a
          frequency to allow you to be transported instantly to other
          dimensions.Mystics of the past have tried in vain to express their experiences
          in words -grasping at metaphors, symbols, mythology, poetry, tales of
          enchantmentand magic to translate their experiences into a form accessible by
          humans.All of them have failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          These worlds are the origin of magic and wonder, yet at the same timethey are
          incredibly natural and real. Magic is only magic to us because it’sour lack of
          comprehending and understanding their natural laws. In otherrealms, ‘magic’ is
          as natural as night and day. The true magic and wonder isthe extension of the
          laws of nature throughout the sum total of all theuniverses with their
          infinite dimensions. Many scientists will tell us that thegreatest miracles
          lie in the perfect workings of nature. The miraculousperfection of nature does
          not stop at the gates of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Chinese sage once said: “The fool considers the miraculous as amiracle. I
          consider the non-miraculous as a miracle.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we begin to chart the territories of the higher dimension, we willfind no
          miracles, only the infinite wonder of creation which unfolds itsperfect
          mechanism and order continually. It does not request belief orworship - it
          requires us only to be and let be. It is indifferent to whether webelieve in
          the existence of a god and is equally gracious towards the atheistor believer.
          It’s a sign of our limited understanding that we turn to beliefsystems,
          whether they are science, religion or philosophy; but being in thepre-dawn of
          our evolution as a species, we can’t be blamed for creating littleislands of
          relative security in the ocean of infinity.

          In my quest to break into new dimensions I made many discoveries aboutthe
          functions of the human mind. i
        </p>
        <p>
          Our physical bodies and our brains have evolved over millions of yearsto
          function in a physical environment. Our sole purpose is to survive in
          aphysical dimension and procreate to safeguard the continuation of thespecies.
          We are used to thinking in three dimensions, and making sense ofthe world in
          new dimensions is an almost insurmountable task. I soondiscovered that the
          dimensions surrounding us are not spatially separated atall, but
          interpenetrate each other in the same way as we can observe
          differentwavelengths in the same space. Our brain is attuned only to visible
          light andaudible sound; it is used to thinking in time and space, neither of
          whichexists in the same way in the higher dimensions. Bringing back
          impressionsfrom the next world is difficult enough, but it was only by
          impressing theimages I brought back into the grey matter of the brain that I
          was able recallthe events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our physical habits also colour our experience in the next world. I
          soondiscovered that I used physical methods to break through
          dimensionalbarriers, which presented themselves as ‘physical’ obstacles.
          Gradually, as Iemployed these physical means, I noticed that the correct
          mental attitudebegan to form - but until then my efforts were very
          frustrating. The matter ofthe higher dimension is so fluid and dynamic that it
          will respond naturally toour_expectations and ideas and will create such
          ‘physical’ barriers where
        </p>
        <p>there are none.</p>

          (Beginning of journal entry missing) To my relief, the light was muchbrighter
          - more like ordinary daytime in the physical world. I was atthe front door of
          the house (of my mother) in an instant, simply byvisualising it.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The house had changed. There was now a balcony on the firstfloor and
          everything was modernised. I went towards the front doorand to my great
          surprise I was greeted by my sister-in-law. Being herextrovert cheerful self
          she laughed out loud and gave me a welcominghug. We started chatting, and then
          I realised that it was not mymother’s house at all and wondered how I could
          have made such amistake. But it wasn’t my brother’s house either. I asked her
          whethershe knew where we were. She answered very confidently that we werein my
          home town. I pointed towards the large factory building in thedistance and
          said that this couldn't be the town I grew up in becausethat building didn’t
          exist where I was from. For a moment she lookedconfused, then she pointed in
          another direction, saying that shebelieved the place I described must be over
          there. I said I had to go andwished her goodbye.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lifted off the ground but somehow did not manage to gain anygreat height.
          Wherever I looked I saw high voltage wires crisscrossingthe landscape and I
          was eager to find a gap, anxious not to getelectrocuted. At the same time I
          was puzzled by the strangesubconscious forces which had put them there. Were
          they the creationof some unknown fear of mine or the work of some unknown
        </p>
        <p>9 adversaries trying to block my escape?</p>
        <p>
          With a strong effort of will I shot through a gap between the wiresand into
          the sky. I sailed easily over open countryside and then I cameto an abrupt
          stop. I looked around. I was in the corner of a small greyroom. I walked
          towards a window, took to the air again and zoomedoff, only to find myself
          trapped in the same little room again. Again Iclimbed out of the window, and
          this time I was over the opencountryside. But when I looked down I saw to my
          amazement that
        </p>
        <p>
          6 events are not in any sequential order but grouped by type of experiences,
        </p>
        <p>
          everything had turned white. What I saw was not countryside at all butwrinkled
          bed sheets. All of a sudden I had a powerful flashback to mychildhood, when my
          brother and I jumped from a chest of draws ontothe bed pretending to be
          aeroplanes, and then me lying on my sidestudying the wrinkles of the sheet. I
          considered the possibility that myflying had triggered a memory from my
          childhood when I ‘flew’ fromthe sideboard, looking down onto the landscape of
          sheets. With thesethoughts still clearly in my mind I opened my physical
          eyes.For a few moments I considered how powerful the force of our—
          subconscious is, that it is able to create whole worlds that feel asphysical
          as anything on Earth. The implications for our future in thenext dimension
          seemed overwhelming.I tried to go back to sleep, but as soon as I closed my
          eyes I was back— in the countryside again, fully lucid and awake. It was like
          walking out of— the bedroom door into another room. This experience spurred me
          on toexperiment with flipping between the states of full waking consciousness
          7in the other dimension and physical waking consciousness in this one. I
          Jdiscovered that there was no difference at all.

          I woke up in the middle of the night with a pain in my eye. It was agrain of
          sand and it was really beginning to irritate me. I went to thebathroom to try
          to remove it, Finally, with my eye still hurting I wentback to bed to focus on
          the pineal gland. After twenty or thirty minutesof unsatisfying meditation I
          had had enough and tried to go to sleep.But my eye was throbbing, so I focused
          instead on the pain until itceased. Then I fell asleep.Moments later I woke up
          again. The pain had gone but I was— blind. It was pitch black around me. I
          reasoned that there should havebeen at least some ambient level of light
          falling through the windowfrom the street lights into the room, but the black
          was solid. For amoment I considered whether I had gone blind during the night
          andwhether the grain of sand was not sand at all but a curious and sudden.eye
          infection.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 groped around but could not feel the bed. This was confusing.When I got up I
          noticed a strange absence of body weight which toldme that I had woken in my
          subtle body, while physically I was stillasleep. I focused all my energy on
          regaining my vision and slowly the
        </p>
        <p>
          ~ room began to emerge like out of a dark mist. I moved around until
          mysurrounding was established in all its reality,
        </p>
        <p>
          1 saw Julia lying in bed talking to herself in her sleep. I wasn’tsure what
          level I was on because my physical body had vanished from~ her side. I decided
          to slip back into physical consciousness to find out
        </p>
        <p>
          what was really happening. When I did so I found my wife fast asleep,= not
          talking, I entered the second state again and almost instantly Iheard Julia
          talking in her sleep again, laughing and being silly. I darted
        </p>
        <p>52 7 back to my physical body only to discover that she was quiet.</p>
        <p>
          Why I decided I would get more out of this experience if I ventured outof the
          house and investigated the other world and its possibilities.Outside it was
          raining, and I noticed with curiosity that I could feel thelight drizzle on my
          skin as I hovered under a streetlight. My perception‘was not good: it began to
          dim and my mind became dull. I was afraidof falling asleep and began chanting
          my mantra. In an instant I shotinto the night sky like Superman. I experienced
          an invigorating sense ofpower and strength. L knew I could stop the rain, and
          I did. My powerwas such that I could turn the rain on and off like a tap (in
          the physicalreality it rained all that night) and I had only used my mantra
          once.When I used it for the second time I shot up through the clouds like
          arocket. I hovered momentarily above the clouds, which glowed in thelight from
          the town below. Above me was a starlit sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third time I used my mantra, its stupendous poweraccelerated me into deep
          space. The further I travelled, the greater thepleasure I felt. There was no
          stopping me now. The mantra gave metotal assurance and protection. I felt safe
          and I travelled through spacewith the greatest ease, exhilarated by a freedom
          unknown before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, without warning, I hit a barrier in the middle of space.When I looked I
          found enormous flower petals, miles in diameter,pulsating and breathing and
          impregnable. I had come to a full stop. Iconsidered using my mantra, but
          something told me that this was theend of my journey - a natural limitation. I
          decided to return to my bodyto consider my options.
        </p>
        <p>
          \ baciBack in my bed, I didn’t bother to seek physical waking and Iheard Julia
          shouting and laughing. Evidently her dream was still inprogress and it must
          have been very amusing. I went through all themeditation techniques I had
          practised over the years and finally wentoutside again. There was traffic on
          the road, A lorry came thunderingtowards me and I escaped to the roof. My
          awareness became sluggish. Iwas afraid of drifting into a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          To establish full waking consciousness I focused on my hand as Ihad done many
          times in the past, but I had no body. Only with greatconcentration did it
          start to emerge. My hands first, appearing likemaggots out of eggs, forming
          into embryonic visions. Finally theylooked human. From the roof I went back
          into my room, still focusingon my hands, while fighting against the blurriness
          of my vision.Gradually the room brightened up and I could make out the pattern
          ofthe wallpaper, which was odd, because our physical flat was paintedplainly
          with emulsion. I realised that I was on another level. I noticedalso that a
          variety of strange emotions were drifting through me like acircus procession.
          They didn’t seem to belong to me. With detachment Iwatched them marching
          through me and away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided it was time to meet the barrier. I was already on anotherlevel and
          thought it should be easier to get higher this time. I onlymade it to the
          ceiling, not even the roof. Again I was stopped by theflower petal and nothing
          I could do would move it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isank into my bed and then into my body. I surrendered from thebattle and felt
          strangely peaceful. Gradually a deep inner contentmentfilled my whole being.
        </p>
        <p>Iwas, I existed, Iam.</p>
        <p>
          There was nothing to aim for, nothing to gain. There were nomountains to
          climb, there was no space to conquer there was only theeternal peace of the
          present. I am.

        <h4>2nd September 1979</h4>
        <p>
          This had been a frustrating and challenging time. My wife was sevenmonth's
          pregnant and we had just moved into our first proper home, amodest terraced
          house. I was earning a living working in a small advertising
        </p>
        <p>
          agency and was struggling to acclimatise to the new commitments
          andresponsibilities. The largest room in the house was put aside for a
          studiowhere I could pursue my love of painting, while at night and in the
          earlyhours of the morning I tried to keep up my spiritual quest by
          practisingmeditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          ~~ That morning I had left my body several times during meditationbut had come
          back just as quickly. Using the force of natural desire, Ifocused on my
          mother’s house in Germany. Suddenly I was torn out ofmy body and catapulted
          through the air so swiftly that I didn’t knowwhat had hit me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of being taken to the front garden of her house as I hadexpected, I
          was catapulted into a deep black abyss. It was as if I wastraveling though a
          tunnel miles in diameter. For a moment I consideredwhat the outcome would be
          if I had the courage to allow myself to bedropped into this awesome void -
          whether I would come out of it alive.Thad no guarantee that this would not be
          my final moment: my lifesealed with a spectacular drop into a black abyss. I
          felt the risk was toogreat and instead decided to chant my mantra to take
          control. I wastorn out of the hole instantly and tossed into the air like a
          ball. I clungstubbornly to my mantra, refusing to be the subject of some
          natural or
        </p>
        <p>
          = unnatural force wanting to take control of me. Gradually mymovements calmed
          down and instead of being torn and kicked I wasblown and rocked gently like a
          feather in a mild summer's breeze.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still I had no control. Whether it was the mantra that was theprimal
          automotive force or some other power, I wanted to be the one todecide where I
          would go, so I made a powerful effort of will to rise ashigh as I could in
          order to penetrate the next higher dimension. I rosehigher but then I hit a
          sudden barrier. I saw an intricate, richly ornateceiling. If it hadn’t caused
          my sudden dead-end, I would have enjoyedlooking at the ceiling; but anyway,
          that wasn’t why I was here. Nomatter how hard I pushed, the ornate barrier did
          not move. I tried toemploy my mantra, but it was no use. I cried for help and
          assistance,but I was on my own.
        </p>
        <p>No matter what I tried, the ceiling was solid, stretching infinitely</p>
        <p>
          across the sky. There was no way around or through it. I becamefrustrated and
          then angry until I cried. I sobbed like a child. The barrier
        </p>
        <p>
          remained. I was astonished by the power of my emotion and the hurt,the kind of
          which I hadn't experienced since early childhood when Ifirst realised that I
          could not control the world and then exploded into atantrum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotionally exhausted, I woke up in my body. I felt disappointedand let down
          for the rest of the day.
        </p>

        <h3>A fight to the death</h3>
        <h4 id="a-fight-to-the-death">3rd of September 1979</h4>
        <p>
          Again I found myself out in the open with a firm commitment to makeit into the
          next higher dimension from where I was. I chanted mymantra and rose high into
          the blue sky instantly. Without warning I hitthe obstacle so hard that I
          feared losing my consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then remembered that Robert Monroe? had encountered similarobstacles, but I
          could not recall how he overcame them. Anyhow, thiswas different. This
          obstacle jeopardised my spiritual future, Itreminded me of my limitations. It
          put my integrity and character intoquestion. It challenged my strength and
          wisdom. I kept pushing,banging against it, trying to find a weak spot, but it
          was as hard asrock. I chanted the mantra pathetically, but all my power was
          soakedup with frustration. I felt insulted, then sad about my lack of control.
        </p>
        <p>
          While probing and pushing against the ceiling I became awaregradually of the
          nature of the barrier and concluded that it was a
        </p>
        <p>
          — psychological barrier, a flaw in my character. I did not have to searchlong
          before becoming aware of my overbearing self-importance andvanity. It was as
          if it was written right across the barriers, Otherunsavory character traits
          stared at me as if from a mirror. I saw all thethings about myself I would
          never have suspected. I cringed when Iimagined how obvious they must have been
          all along to other people. Ifelt ashamed and pitied myself for my weaknesses,
          which were alldancing in front of my eyes, sneering at me, mocking and
          ridiculing melike demons released from captivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of feeling guilt and remorse I felt resentful. I refused toclaim them,
          denied myself ownership of them. I knew it was hopeless

          to get past them, but instead of showing humility I became angry. Myanger and
          cowardice was mocked as I turned away and darted downinto the abyss towards my
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I woke up in my physical body but kept my eyes closed. I neededclosure and
          wanted to return, When I opened my nonphysical eyesagain I was standing at the
          bottom of a large stony gothic staircase withblack iron rails. At the top of
          the stairs was a heavy wooden door. I hada sense of foreboding, a feeling of
          impending doom. I climbed the stairshesitatingly, haltingly, step by step,
          until suddenly I knew what was behind the door.
        </p>
        <p>— It was death.</p>
        <p>
          Not just any old death you could rationalise or philosophiseaway, but real
          death: physical and spiritual death - the destruction ofmy body, mind and
          soul; the pain and the anguish of the people Iwould leave behind - the
          daughter who hadn’t even been born yet; theshock and horror of the people who
          would say that only a few hoursago they had spoken to me and seen no signs of
          illness. But the greaterdeath would be the one which only I would notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was death that would cut everything short: my dreams, myambitions -
          everything I had nurtured for this life of only thirty threeyears. It was the
          end for all the pictures I wanted to paint and thethings I wanted to do, and
          the family I wanted to raise; it was also thedeath of my spiritual being.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was still time to tum and run, but then I noticed withhorror that every
          step of the staircase had death carved into it. It wasalready too late. Death
          knew that I was coming and it was waiting forme.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped, frozen with fear. Then I became angry. “How dare you” I shouted as
          I stormed up the stairs. “How dare you provoke me. How dare you confront me and
          stop me!”
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top of the stairs I threw open the door, and there he was,sitting on a
          chair - hideous, mean and motionless, staring me in theface, pinning his
          hideous eyes on me, trying to force me to submit.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all my power I screamed and hurled myself at the figure,knocking him off
          his perch. We tumbled down the stairs, me screamingand punching, him laughing.
          We slammed against the ground at the
        </p>
        <p>bottom of the stairs. I was still punching and kicking him when I woke</p>
        <p>up in the physical world, weak and trembling.</p>
        <p>I tried to analyse it rationally, recalling Freud and Jung. I began to</p>
        <p>
          = speculate whether I had killed the demons of my character who had mocked
        </p>
        <p>
          and humiliated me. I hoped I had, but I wasn’t sure. I felt humbled, but
          notdefeated.

          Changes between ordinary dreams and lucid dreams can be gradual. Theonly thing
          that changes is the consciousness. At the moment of awakening, ~two things may
          happen: dream content is stripped away suddenly, leavingme with a ‘normal’
          awareness of reality, or dream content does not change at |all, only my
          awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that sceptics may never be convinced. I am sure there is plentyof
          speculation that all that happens is an abnormal brain function whichcreates
          awareness in a dream, hence a lucid dream. But one thing that othersas well as
          myself have noticed during travels out-of-the-body, is that thereexists a link
          to the physical body in the form of a thin luminous fibrousstring, often
          referred to as the umbilical or silver cord. Although I have notalways been
          aware of it when having a lucid dream, on many occasions Ihave. Is this
          ‘physical evidence’ enough to prove that we are in anotherdimensional
          environment, attached to the ‘real’ world by a communicationcord, rather than
          in a dream resulting from unusual brain activity?
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally I have experienced a violent pull from the cord which hasyanked
          me back into the physical body, experiencing a movement throughspace and even
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this occasion I was having a dream, driving in an oldVolkswagen through a
          strange and unfamiliar town on the lookout forsomething or somebody but unsure
          of what exactly. The sky was darkand thundery and it felt like it was going to
          rain at any moment. As Idrove into the town the scene began to brighten. To my
          delight Inoticed parts of the sky becoming lighter. I decided to stop the car
          in
        </p>
        <p>
          order to find out where I was. There were no people in the street, andwhen I
          parked my car in front of a house I decided I would go in.
        </p>
        <p>At that moment my mind became very clear and jolted me into</p>
        <p>
          — full wakefulness. I was delighted. The fact that my dream had assumeda
          dimension of reality overwhelmed me immediately with excitement. Iwas allowed
          to do as I please. Still, I decided to enter the house, andwithout knocking I
          went in. I was greeted by two young women whoseemed to be pleased to see me.
          Their demeanor was very friendly andpleasant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lintroduced myself and asked their names. One was called Clareand the other
          was Glen. I tried to explain to them, rather clumsily, that Idid not really
          belong to their world, as they were so obviously deadwhile I was still in
          possession of a physical body. They found mycomment rather amusing and said
          that it was quite obvious that I was
        </p>
        <p>
          = alive as I was attached to the luminous cord. It was only then that Ispotted
          to my great astonishment that I had been dragging a cordaround with me which
          came literally out of the centre of my body anddisappeared into the ground. It
          consisted of two very fine lines of some
        </p>
        <p>
          J kind of electric blue energy, intertwined and pulsating like electric wire|
          though much less solid. I felt a current passing through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the girls touched it when she pointed it out and I felt atingling
          sensation in my stomach. They both burst out laughing at myreaction. Their
          cheerfulness was infectious. I felt in a silly mood: Igrabbed the cord with
          one hand and placed my foot on the end whereit came out of the floor and
          proceeded to pluck at it like a bass player. Imade bass sounds with my mouth.
          Soon the girls were in stitches.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the burst of entertainment came to an end we started totalk. They
          confirmed that they knew they were ‘dead’ but when I askedwhere we were in
          relation to the physical world they appeareduncertain, They said they would
          ask their friend who was moreinterested and knowledgeable in these matters,
          and almost instantlytheir friend appeared in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile I became more and more distracted, looking out ofthe window. Instead
          of questioning the new girl, I became moreinterested in making gentle
          somersaults in the air. It seemed to amusemy audience. I explained that this
          was such a relatively rare event that Ineeded to take full advantage of it and
          explore their world by myself,
          and with this I passed effortlessly through the window and out into thestreet.
          The girls followed, obviously intrigued by what folly I wouldcome up with
          next.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then remembered that the whole point of being in this state wasto capitalise
          on it by using my meditation practices, namely chantingone of my powerful
          mantras.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘On this level these mantras really had power and their effect
          wasinstantaneous. As soon as I completed the first chant I shot
          upexhilaratingly into the air leaving everyone standing and looking up atme,
          then I descended gently to earth. The next chant took me evenhigher until the
          bright blue sky turned dark indigo. I rose higher andhigher until I struck the
          familiar ornate ceiling. I felt like a fly stuck in agigantic spider’s web
          made from millions of intricate luminous fibers.In the centre of the ceiling
          was a gigantic pattern like a huge lotusflower. I knew I had to go through
          that gate, but I didn’t know how. Inmy frustration I decided to wake up in my
          body.
