        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          Trying to write about something that can neither be backed up by
          scientificproof nor sound collaborating evidence, especially when it
          deals with therealms of the mind, opens the possibility for doubt or
          (quite likely) ridicule.But rather than waste space asserting the
          existence of another dimensionwhere life continues after death and
          which we can visit whilst still alive,would like to refer the skeptics
          to the vast collection of current literaturewhich argues the point for
          me. I simply want to share my adventures andclaim boldly that they
          have taken place in other dimensions - dimensionswhich lie at the very
          heart of our existence, whether we realise it or not. Thisclaim will
          make more sense as you read further through these journals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The records in this book have been compiled over a period of
          nearlyforty years and deal exclusively with a novel form of
          out-of-body experience,which I believe is a natural byproduct of
          regular and intensive meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am encouraged by the fact that scientists are coming round to the
          ideathat there must be other dimensions (at least another eleven
          according tosome string theorists), in order to explain our physical
          existences. Alsoencouraging is the fact that research focuses
          increasingly on the subatomicworld and quantum world - because of the
          increasingly higher prizes theyyield, but also because of the
          increasing attention that is being placed onresearch into the
          phenomena of consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, I am no scientist. I am an artist by trade. Having made my
          markas a fantasy artist it would be easy to conclude that this book is
          simply theresult of a fertile imagination. In fact it is the other way
          round. My passionwas for abstract art until the late eighties, my
          fantasy work was inspired by
        </p>
        <p>— what I found when visiting other worlds when out of my body.</p>
        <p>
          The images I created inspired many publishers to commission me
          for‘book covers: for science fiction, mythology, dreams,
          mind-body-spirit - evenangels and fairies (which I always regarded
          more as powerful archetypes
        </p>
        <p>
          7, than objective reality, as Lhad never come across any of these
          creatures).Although I have a very open mind and respect some mediums
          who are ableto break the barriers of our physical perception, readers
          should not concludethat I am anew age evangelist. Far from it. My
          livelihood is earned running asixty-hour-a-week business in a tough
          commercial advertising environment,which has made me a very practical
          person. I don’t subscribe to beliefsystems other than what I
          experience personally. I don’t follow a philosophyor religion. I
          neither believe nor disbelieve in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite my busy life-style, finding a couple of hours per day
          formeditation has always been my priority for the last forty years. If
          I were tocompress the time spent in meditation together in one big
          lump, I wouldhave been away for a whole three years, residing in a
          state of consciousnesswhich is radically different from what we
          experience normally in our dailywaking lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is only too obvious that such intensive practice has affected my
          mindin the same way that two hours at the gym every day would have had
          aneffect on my body! It is this practice to which I attribute the
          experiences laidout in these journals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular and deep meditation has provided me with focusing power,
          adetachment from personal identification and even an indifference
          towardshow these reports may be judged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, I have always regarded meditation as a process of
        </p>
        <p>
          » unlocking the deeper mysteries of the reality of self and who I am.
          I havenever pursued it as a means of leaving my body. Most experiences
          recordedhere, with a few exceptions, were spontanegus, and I have yet
          to succeed indeveloping a technique to guarantee deliberate conscious
          projection
        </p>
        <p>
          consistently. But this is unlikely to happen. I see meditation as a
          means toattain loftier goals than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have only recorded experiences where I was in full
          wakingconsciousness. Dreams, however vivid, did not qualify as
          relevant. I had tohave full control over all my faculties as in waking
          life, ie. identity of self;awareness that I was out of my body and an
          awareness of where my physicalbody was at the time and its social
          identity; full powers of discrimination;full control over decision
          making; and awareness of all my senses. In short,the same criteria of
          waking consciousness as experienced in waking life.‘These experiences
          are not visions, dreams, fantasies or imaginations, but realwaking
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some instances the waking consciousness was so authentic that
          therewas literally no break in consciousness when returning from the
          higherdimension to the physical environment. All I had to do was to
          open myeyelids. It was like blinking while walking from one room to
          the next. Thedimensions are so incredibly close and interconnected
          that they can benavigated in an instant without a break in
          consciousness. Most of the timethough, I paused before opening my eyes
          to run through the events in orderto impress them on the physical
          brain, Without this process of rehearsing andrecollection the memory
          would be lost. In those cases the only thing broughtacross would be a
          sense of having been lucid, but with little or no recollectionof the
          experiences in the next dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          The events in this book are not reproduced in chronological order,
          butthe order was rearranged to favour the narrative format. I hope
          this helps toput the experiences across in a more logical format,
          which makes it easier torelate to. In reality, states of consciousness
          do not follow the laws of time ordevelopment but are dependent on
          psychological conditions,
        </p>
        <p>
          The reader will also notice that there is a gap of twenty years in
          myjournal entries. The reason for this is that my attention was
          increasinglydiverted towards building a career and to supporting my
          family. Although Ikept my meditation practice up during this time, I
          was more concerned withfocusing on the here-now reality and to coping
          with the pressures of anactive working life. I still manifested
          out-of-body experiences, though theywere rare and not recorded. It was
          like being a tourist without a camera,
        </p>
        <p>
          though they still added in general terms to completing a picture of
          the higherdimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          llIna sense this book is not just about out-of-body experiences, but
          alsoabout a voyage of self discovery, the realisation of sovereignty,
          personalfreedom, independence from belief systems, and the attainment
          of states ofconsciousness which go beyond everyday awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel it is important that information gathered in alternate states
          ofawareness as I have described in these journals is shared and made
          availableto enhance our knowledge and understanding of human nature
          and perhapsthe underlying mechanics of the physical universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tam convinced that separation from the body happens to all of us at
        </p>
        <p>
          = night and that we draw from other dimensions every waking minute of
          ourlives. I also believe that separation from the body takes place at
          a subatomic —rather than molecular level, and if scientists were to
          have similar privilegesas I have, I am sure their
          scientifically-conditioned enquiries would unravelinsights into the
          mechanics of creation that would set the world alight!
        </p>
        <p>
          I can imagine that when they have reached the physical limitations
          ofbuilding increasingly large particle accelerators in order to
          penetrate themysteries of the atom, scientists may well opt for
          alternative means ofresearch and converge with scientists from other
          disciplines - for exampleStanford University Professor Stephen
          LaBerge!, who investigates thephenomena of lucid dreaming. As a
          scientist, he restricts his research to therealms of dreams and
          consciousness rather that hypothesising about otherdimensions, which
          he would be unable to prove. As an artist, I have no suchrestrictions,
          hence I would like to suggest that we live in a
          multi-dimensionaluniverse, which we can visit simply by walking
          through the right doors inour mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          T hope you will enjoy reading these travel journals for what they
          are,and with an open mind.
