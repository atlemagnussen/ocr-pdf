        <h2>The final frontiers</h2>
        <p>
          How is it possible that events we regard as happening only within our
          threepounds of brain tissue can be as real as in our waking life? How is it
          possiblethat we can experience worlds inside our heads so much grander than
          theone we encounter with our eyes open? How can we possibly tie
          theseexperiences merely to the firing of nerve-endings in our physical
          brains?What is this brain anyway when it is broken down into its constituent
          parts?It is no more and no less than a galaxy of energy: particles, atoms,
          protonsand electrons, and so forth. What and where are these particles? Are
          they onthe inside or the outside? And is there such a thing as inside and
          outside?Where does the territory of our being begin and end?
        </p>
        <p>Where do all our experiences really take place?</p>
        <p>
          I cannot decide which is the more miraculous: our out-of-bodyexperiences as
          the result of electric activity between nerve endings within ourbrains, or as
          the result of activities in other dimensions. To me the formerseems to be the
          more outrageous and far-fetched. Some skeptics insist thatout-of-body
          experiences are phenomena of neural function and that what weexperience is
          probably no more than a fantasy. Yes, but what is this fantasy,and where is it
          enacted? How does a chemical process create it? Does it notmake more sense to
          extend the established fact of this worldly dimensionwith all its still
          unsolved mysteries into another dimension? This wouldmake more sense and would
          allow us to approach the whole complex issuefrom a more scientific angle.
          Simply, it will not do for people to put peoplewho have out-of-body
          experiences into a metaphorical new-age loony binjust because they cannot
          bring themselves to accept that there are things inthe world that we cannot
          explain with the logic of our left brain hemisphere.For many, if it is not
          testable by traditional scientific methods then it does not
        </p>
        <p>
          warrant serious investigation. Could it be that certain scientific methods
          mayjust be a little too limited?
        </p>
        <p>
          From my point of view, as one who has been subject to out-of-bodyexperiences,
          I find it more plausible and ‘down-to-earth’ to consider that alllife in the
          physical universe is the offshoot of a multidimensional super-universe.
          Multiple-universes theories have been made already by string-theorists, though
          whether the dimensions I am speaking of are anything likewhat they had in mind
          is uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, scientists will have to abandon their pursuit of the
          unifyingtheory of everything (or M-Theory), because the new dimensions are
          beyondthe scope of language in this three-dimensional environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that in order to penetrate deeper into the mysteries of creationmore
          use should be made of the right brain hemisphere, by focusing onsound beyond
          words, on intuition rather than mathematics, and on directexperience rather
          than hypothesis. Perhaps in a hundred years from nowScientific experiments may
          be conducted in new ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Counting the nerve endings and cataloguing and categorising the partsin our
          three-dimensional skull, may bring big benefits in understandingbehavior and
          the phenomena of our cognitive systems, but they won't solvethe core mystery
          behind our fantastic brain. And for scientists to considerany form of
          space-travel beyond the solar system, they may have to considerrevolutionary
          nonphysical means of travel. Many out-of-body travelers willtell them that
          they can save themselves billions of dollars by focusing their
        </p>
        <p>
          — efforts on a specific point within their brain in oder to open the wormhole
          toanother galaxy. I have already documented how time travel works in aPrevious
          chapter™, All that is needed is a scientific mindset to access the
          rightinformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present, many out-of-body experiences don’t take us much furtherthan beyond
          the ‘I'm flying - isn’t that amazing!’ level. People feel it is saferand
          socially more acceptable to talk about traditional scientific methods
          andexperiences, so that they can keep face in front of friends and colleagues.
          AParadigm shift towards new science may requires a bold, slightly loony (inthe
          eyes of most) explorer, who is not overly concerned about his image,
          whobeavers away quietly in his out-of-body laboratory until he emerges
          sleepy-eyed with the first live ‘broadband’ link to our deceased relatives.

        <p>
          Thave nearly reached the end of the book, and I feel I should end it with
          oneof my most sustained and powerful experiences to date. Although it
          wasentered into my journal way back in 1980, it was one of the most
          in-depth,most vibrant out-of-body experiences I have ever had, spanning
          severalhours and penetrating into the heart of creation, or what I saw as the
          core
        </p>
        <p>
          dimension of reality. It is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid using
          overly-
        </p>
        <p>
          poetic language or the terminology of the mystics, because simply there is
        </p>
        <p>
          not as yet a common understanding of what pure reality is. I hope you will
        </p>
        <p>look beyond my limitations and employ your own intuition to fill in any</p>
        <p>gaps, because I am certain that what I experienced may ring strangely</p>
        <p>
          familiar to some people. You may have already been there in deep sleep, but
        </p>
        <p>unable to bring it through the physical barriers of the brain. What I saw</p>
        <p>
          appears to be at the very core of our nature and I find it impossible to
          believe
        </p>
        <p>that I am on my own in having experienced it.</p>
        <p>
          Apart from noting down the most important points in my diary overseveral
          pages, I relied on the non-verbal power of my right brain hemisphereto keep
          the memory of what I had witnessed in a more intuitive and visualformat than I
          could have recorded on paper. Even now, using deep +meditation to recall and
          to a degree relive the event, I struggle to avoid cliché |when describing it.
          Yet the event gave me a new perspective on many of themysteries of our being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The super-reality I experienced in this state of consciousness madeordinary
          life appear almost trivial - like random thought, not even a dream. Ihave the
          feeling that consciousness on these high dimensions may be ourfuture common
          ground as a human species. Compared to this, we in ourpresent state of
          evolution are like some prehistoric creature emerging fromthe mud.
        </p>
        <p>
          The powers available to us will be immense. We will be interwovenintricately
          with a supreme cosmic intelligence. We may already be thebeneficiaries of our
          future selves, who can project themselves into any one ofour past, present and
          future lives and assert a guiding influence if so chosen.We are our own
          guardian angel, spirit guide and mentor. We are our ownGod. We become the one
          who answers our prayers. Only then will we be, asthe Christian bible says,
          “created in the image of God”.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would not be telling the truth if I claimed that leaving my body
          andtraveling into new fantastic worlds in full waking consciousness
          andexperiencing total freedom was not one of the most incredible adventures
          aperson could ever dream of. But as unbelievable as it may sound,
          exploringdimensions beyond the physical was not the key quest of my adventures
          -the reason being that I had tasted something of considerably higher value”.
          Inever spoke about it, perhaps because I was afraid that my art studentfriends
          at that time would refer to it as the ‘cheese sandwich experience’,cheapening
          it to simply rye bread and Tilsiter cheese, rather than the moreglamorous
          sounding ‘Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus’ experience I thought itwas. Modern
          psychology would probably be kinder and call it ‘a peak-experience brought
          about by excessive neuron activity within such-and-sucha part of the
          whatsitsname cortex’.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never saw it as anything more than a ‘wake-up call’, which put thereality of
          my life into clear perspective. Compared to the rich wine of thatexperience,
          out-of-body-experiences were like water. I saw it as a beacon inthe landscape
          of my life, to which I could direct my course. I had a new‘outlook in my life,
          Any experience I had from then I compared instinctivelyto it, and no matter
          how extraordinary they were they always left mewanting more.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was that experience in 1972 which made me rediscover meditation asthe way
          forward. For the next eight years I stuck to a strict regime in order to
          unearth similar experiences. All I wanted was the simple truth of who I am
          the truth behind appearances; to find out what reality was, untainted
          byperception, conditioning and opinion. This had always ranked as the
          numberone goal of my journey through life. Out-of-the-body experiences were
          like akind of sideshow - perks that came with the job. Ironically, I had
          neverenvisaged that this ‘sideshow’ would ultimately unravel a spectacle
          ofcosmic proportions. It became clear that the path leading me beyond thebody
          was the path of my destiny and that the ‘show’ aspect was simply inkeeping
          with my visionary nature as an artist. But I cannot say with anycertainty that
          this facet would have developed at all had it not been for myintensive
          meditation practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I am much older my meditation is more accomplished, intensiveand
          prolonged, and out-of-body journeys are less of an issue and so occur
        </p>
        <p>21 See page J, chapter Ancient Masters</p>
        <p>
          much less frequently. The real benefits of meditation are that I have
          gainedcontrol over my thoughts and consequently the quality of my life
          hasincreased exponentially. Despite working hard to earn my living, often
          forsixty hours a week, my life has become more rewarding and enjoyable,carried
          on a note of thrill and joyful anticipation. I practice meditation everyday
          without fail as part of my routine. What I thought of reality back in 1980was
          different to how I experience it now.
        </p>
        <p>
          One would think, therefore, that such a profound inner experience asthe
          following would more likely have happened in later years. In fact, ithappened
          nearly thirty years ago, when I was a relative novice in yoga. Butall this
          shows is the relative value of such ‘cosmic visions’, whereas now Iknow that
          awareness of reality has a much more profound effect on life thana night out
          of the body. I suspect the following experience was simply theculmination of a
          powerful desire to uncover the core level of reality or truth,to find insight
          and understanding rather than a constant awareness of aliving present. It was
          underpinned by stillness and the quiet underlyingecstasy of being alive, which
          is much more part of my life now.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the very least it gave me a hint of the origin of the greater reality,which
          is at the very basis of life and gives an inkling of things to come.

        <h3 id="the-final-journey">The final journey</h3>
        <h4>25th August 1980</h4>
        <p>
          Thad a restless night with only patches of
          sleep. I got up very early,about half-past-four in the morning, and went into
          my studio intendingto meditate in order to go back to bed to catch up with
          some muchneeded sleep. Meditation was great for this. Not only did it relax
          me,but I had discovered that it could initiate a drowsy dreamlike state,which
          felt very wholesome and enjoyable. I would then almost_- sleepwalk back to my
          bed with my eyes hardly open and sink instantly— into a deep, blissful sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I wasn’t tired at all. I looked at some of the paintings I hadproduced
          during the previous weeks. One in particular caught myattention. It was
          abstract, four feet by three feet, created with broad freebrush strokes. I
          always strived as best as I could to destroy anyemergence of pictorial imagery
          in the painting in order to remainpurely abstract and I thought I had
          succeeded with this work. But I
        </p>
        <p>
          hadn’t. Now it was like I was looking through the gaps of a half-opencurtain
          into another world. True, there were no pictorial elements, butthe painting
          was anything but abstract. It was an unworldly landscape
        </p>
        <p>
          — cast in pink and blue lights. The feelings this evoked startled me. I
          waslooking at something I had never seen before. Only once before had
          Iexperienced something similar: when I looked at a painting by MarkRothko; but
          that was on a quite different level. This went far, far deeper,probably
          because it was my painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I closed my eyes and began to meditate. Then I must havefallen
          asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my dream I was walking with a small group of people throughwild
          countryside. The colours were rich and vivid. Abundant mosscovered huge fallen
          trees and it was as if I was walking through apainting by the German romantic
          artist Caspar David Friedrich, or a
        </p>
        <p>
          film set for The Lord of the Rings (which, of course, is my view
          fromhindsight).
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually the scene began to change until we came to a halt infront of a huge
          incongruous piece of architecture blocking our path. Infact, its presence was
          so monstrous in its monotony that I wonderedwhat freakish power had put it
          here. It was so out of character with the
        </p>
        <p>
          — environment that I realised at once that I was ina dream. I paused to letthe
          realisation sink in until I had establish full waking consciousness.The people
          I had been with were no longer there. I was on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of curiosity I entered the building. I was aware more thanever that in
          this world objects had little function other than to serve assymbols,
          signposts or challenges. This was the world of mind-over-matter rather than
          matter-over-mind. Contemplating its significance, Ientered the building and
          found myself in a gigantic hall. At the verycentre was a large spiral
          staircase that went so high that I could hardlysee the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without further delay I walked up the staircase and soon driftedrapidly
          towards the very top, just under the roof. Here the stairs cameto an
          inexplicable stop. There was no door, no window - not even ahatch. I knew
          instinctively that in order to get out of the building andonto a higher level
          I had to break through the roof.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my bare fists I started punching a large hole into the roof.Big chunks
          fell out of it as if it was made from porous plasterboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I climbed through the hole in the ceiling and onto a largeplatform.
          To my surprise I found myself in open countryside withgroups of trees on
          either side, only to realise with awe that I was in theinterior of a still
          larger hall, enclosing the whole countrysidesurrounding me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recalled my battles against the ceiling obstacle in the past? and Ibegan to
          wonder whether I was again embarking on a fruitless effort tofight against
          these formidable barriers. Nevertheless, I wanted to findout, so I soared high
          through the hall until I reached the ceiling. I evenadmired the beautiful and
          intricate plasterwork, reminiscent of ancienttemple designs, with gigantic,
          exquisite floral patterns. Yet this was oflittle interest to me and I hacked
          my way through the ceiling with totaldisregard for its artist. Then, climbing
          onto the roof, I found myselfsurrounded by glorious countryside. Pondering my
          adventure, Ilooked into the sky and found to my astonishment that it was
          ornatewith gigantic intricate swirls and patterns. Then I realised that it
          wasthe inside of a huge dome, the roof of yet another gigantic hall, miles
          indiameter but an enclosed space nevertheless. s
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of getting annoyed I sat down and thought about myexperience - not
          just that I had been ascending through various domes,but the stupendous and
          much more profound fact that my personality,my life - my whole being - was by
          now fully transfered into differentreality. Admittedly, this always happened
          whenever I first realised thatI was conscious in another world while my body
          was still asleep, butthis felt different. It_was as if I had uprooted and
          relocated for good.There was no urgency at all to go back to my body and the
          possibilitydawned on me that I may have become a resident here on a
          permanentbasis. On the other hand I still had a vague link to another
          world,which was taking care of my sleeping body. I knew I could reconnectwith
          it simply by shifting my attention, but this was not on my agendanow. I was
          more puzzled by the strange mystery of the experience andits overwhelming
          reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I figured that I was surrounded by mere symbols and yet thesymbols looked as
          real as buildings back on Earth. I was astonished by
        </p>
        <p>how my mind dealt with the phenomena of multidimensional reality. It</p>
        <p>c</p>
        <p>22 See chapter Breaking down baries</p>
        <p>
          had no way of conceiving the reality of this experience other than
          bytranslating it into comprehensible symbols of stacked rooms. There was
        </p>
        <p>wisdom in the way these mysterious forces guided me onwards</p>
        <p>through unknown territory using signposts I could understand.</p>
        <p>
          I felt no desire to rush back to my body. My presence in thisworld was fully
          established, and there was no need to worry aboutbeing interrupted. I might
          just as well have been in another country,physically - it felt so real.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great clarity of my wakefulness and the superb power offocus I was endowed
          with made me realise that I was on the verge of agreat discovery, of
          conquering new dimensions, which had beeninaccessible until now. Fate, or
          whatever else it was, had endowed mewith this luxurious waking consciousness
          in this nonphysical world,and it was a great blessing. All I had to do now was
          proceed withdetermination and focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these insights I rose again into the air like a balloon until Ipassed
          through yet another ornate ceiling. This time I didn’t even haveto use
          ‘physical’ force but passed straight into another massive hall,filling me with
          excitement and expectation. The light in this space wasfar brighter and came
          from all around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling was much more uplifting and I was carried on astream of energy,
          which pulled me onwards like a giant magnet, higherand higher towards a
          ceiling, which dissolved before I even got close.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was extraordinary. The atmosphere was much brighter stillthan before,
          more penetrating and yet very subtle, reaching into everyatom of my being. I
          began to feel uncomfortable. It was like coming infrom the cold into to a warm
          room, still wearing a heavy coat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became unbearable. Something had to give. I was no longer acohesive entity.
          I was conscious that my body was being unrelentinglypulled_apart atom by atom.
          The old molecules, which had made mewhat I thought of as myself, wanted to
          resist, seeking some snugshelter somewhere in a darker region no longer
          reachable. I felt like acondemned man, dying a nonphysical death. But in the
          end it was onlymy resistance which had to perish. Letting go of my attachment
          to my
        </p>
        <p>
          novel costume - my body, which I had been wearing for millennia - wasin fact a
          great liberation. This was the individual which had clung tomy physical
          disguises time and time again, exchanged for a new one
        </p>
        <p>
          whenever the old one was worn out. I was keen to take a look at thevast
          spectrum of these veils - an endless chain of lives, paraded inmillions of
          images in front of my disembodied eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process began to feel joyful once I understood not to cling onto_the old
          heavy matter of my bi burden of the past.Whatever the forces were that ripped
          me apart, they did so not becausethey wanted to destroy me, but out of love,
          pure and unconditional.They wanted me to join them, become part of them, so I
          could entertheir native realm.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no turning back. It was as if I was pulled by invisiblestrings, all
          eager to call me home. This was accompanied by a sweetand beckoning sound,
          which evolved into a choir of enchanting sound,with voices so sweet that there
          was no way I could have resisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I left behind all that I had valued so much, which was really littlemore than
          idle games played with childlike earnestness, and dreamsindulged in and
          lifetimes struggling in search of happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my new pair of eyes I became accustomed to my newsurroundings as if I was
          coming into sunlight for the first time afterbeing trapped in a dark dungeon
          for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before me a sea of pleasure opened in warm sparkling waves anda disembodied
          soprano voice urged me to plunge my heart and soulinto this open ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was not alone. There were millions like myself, sparkling orbs,the souls of
          others, bobbing along on a vast expanse of coloured light,attached to sparking
          filaments fused to a living counterpart down)below in some distant darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever their blind and ignorant physical counterparts were upto, indulging
          in meanness or basking in love, their lights up here werebarely affected by
          what went on below.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the ecstatic storm of my transformation had passed, therewas peace. It
          was like a gathering of my new critical faculties; acalibrating of my new
          instruments of perception. I soon forgoteverything I had learned in the
          limited world of Earth and began toprepare myself for a totally new cognitive
          experience. I was not ina >place or in a time any longer, or in any form;
          instead, I was everywheresimultaneously, except there wasn’t a ‘where’ at all.
          There was just I.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet I was also aware of another presence, which had been with‘me all this
          time. I still couldn’t see it, only knew that it was beside me.It was like
          another me, watching, guarding and guiding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought my journey had ended - I'd reached a unity which gaveme a great
          peace and a clarity of mind, which I drank eagerly. I hadreturned from an
          endless, exhausting voyage, and now it was my timeto rest. I was home at last.
        </p>

        <h3 id="thoughts-and-belief">Thoughts and belief systems</h3>
        <p>
          The journey continuingThis was not home for very long. I heard a roll of
          thunder and the airaround me began to vibrate. On all sides, shapes started to
          emerge outof the light. I noticed that I was standing in the centre of a
          giganpointed patter, which rose up around my feet to form a massive,immensely
          intricate flower reminiscent of a magnolia. It spread out inall directions and
          as it grew it elevated me to dizzying heights, andbefore I knew it I was
          staring down into the infinite depth of space. Butthis expanse was not black
          like our Earth's universe, it was lit by
        </p>
        <p>= myriad spellbinding objects.</p>
        <p>
          Thoughts are curious things, made out of words. Within ourphysical brains they
          appear to be abstract things, attached to objects,which in themselves have no
          substance whatsoever and are strungtogether by recollections of meanings. In a
          sense we are their creatorsand with them we form worlds around us. Until now I
          hadn’t realisedthat here they were living ‘physical’ realities.
        </p>
        <p>For a while now I had been aware of a beautiful entity, like</p>
        <p>y breath unformed, attached to me with gentle hands, giving me a thrill</p>
        <p>
          L-which pulsated through my new body. The moment I became aware ofit, it
          detached and unfolded in front of me like an enormous bloom.
        </p>
        <p>It was love.</p>
        <p>
          And now it had become a thought, a detached object I couldobserve objectively.
          Its inner life had taken on the pulsating power I
        </p>
        <p>
          had felt earlier, and it spread out and unfolded in the space before meas a
          large symmetrical flower. A breath ago it was just a bud, but now itopened
          into even fuller bloom as I pondered its secret. It was evolvingcontinuously,
          drawing its life force seemingly from my attention. From
        </p>
        <p>
          its centre, incredibly elegant blooms unfolded on spiraling stems
          andpirouetted around one another in a joyful dance. The moment theytouched
          they merged and showers of golden dust exploded and otherblooms were spawned,
          even more beautiful than before. This in turninitiated a whole generation of
          blossoms to emerge, forever varyingand evolving in abundance, At the centre of
          the blossom a coreappeared like a fruit and evolved into an organic shrine
          opening itswalls, with blooms sprouting around its entrance beckoning me
          toenter, to rejoin and merge with the love which was so much part of mebefore.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I was too distracted to enter, as an endless armada of giantthought shapes
          was drifting in front of me, each vying for my attention.I could pick on any
          shape at will and its living reality surrounded meon all sides and offered me
          its inner secret. Some were giganticstructures, alien and complex and of
          beguiling mystery and beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Their textures, design and character differed tremendously fromthought form
          to thought form, as did their colours and sounds. It wasonly too easy to be
          seduced by any of these shapes and to apprehendtheir inner meaning. They liked
          nothing more than attention and drewtheir sustenance from it. They were
          animated by a quest for expansion,grabbing sympathetic energy in their path
          like greedy exotic seacreatures. They wove their way around alien matter,
          growing as theygrazed on the energies being sent towards them by orbs of
          light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of them formed colonies covering large territories. I saw theformation of
          whole ideologies and theories, creating complex worldswithin themselves. From
          up here I could see countless belief systems asincredibly complex shapes. I
          saw that once immersed in any of thosestructures the perspective of the world
          changed for good. The centre ofthe thought felt like the centre of the
          universe itself, It was difficult toargue against them, each vying for space
          and attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          How easy it seemed for people to become seduced and ensnaredby these grand
          designs. The sheer presence of them, how each thoughtprovided refuge,
          belonging and identity, because beyond themappeared to be nothing but dark and
          empty space. How many people, Ithought, understand that they have the power to
          rise above andobserve these thoughts for what they are: temporary resting
          places, nomore than inventions, giving us the illusion that we are in control.
          And
        </p>
        <p>m</p>
        <p>Multidimensional Man</p>
        <p>
          yet they were as fleeting as clouds. When my interest waned andattention
          withdrew, they withered away into nothingness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was fascinated by this powerful display. The passions andenergies invested
          in them made them shine and stand out like grandedifices, singing the glory of
          their creators, many of them hypnotisedby their beauty and artistic
          perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally, majestic_structures drifted through my field ofvision with great
          authority, rolling slowly through the vast deep spacelike gigantic alien star
          ships, so vast that I could barely see where theyfinished. Millions of orbs
          were attached to them, attracted by theirsheer size and presence, enjoying the
          ride and the company of fellowcrew members. It was driven by a powerful engine
          at its centre, whichwas nothing less then a gigantic star, sitting at the top
          of a magnificentdome for everyone to see. Inside the dome, millions worshipped
          it liketheir God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another big spaceship caught my attention. This one had the coolbeauty of
          complex geometric ornamentation, joined together skillfullyby billions of
          intricate patterns and shapes like crystals, arrangedingeniously to
          perfection. When looking for its mode of propulsion, Isaw that huge blue orbs
          of light were its energy source, pulling it along,mining knowledge from the
          deep mysterious space surrounding it. Inits wake it created new geometric
          shapes, which were harvestedeagerly and absorbed into the structure of the
          gigantic ship. Any otherforms it encountered were probed with purpose and
          curiosity.Occasionally it unearthed gigantic treasures, which reverberated
          andreconfigured the ship's design and greatly increased its power. Its
          greatauthority was undeniable, because it was multidimensionallyexpanding,
          both laterally and vertically, sending its beneficial energiesinto the worlds
          below. Awestruck by its precision, its clear-cut beautyand perfect design, I
          watched its slow, but unrelenting progress andadmired the scientific ingenuity
          of our species to create such grandstructures. Its charisma was one of
          rationality and reason, cool andmeasured.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were millions of such shapes. Some small but evolving andgrowing, others
          lumbering and fading into the ocean of billions ofthoughts that burst into
          life, clustering around each other like living
        </p>
        <p>
          creatures. This was an enormous world, a whole universe in itself -
          thecreation of man: Gods and creators in our own right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas on Earth my attention could explore each thought onlysequentially,
          here, from a dimension above, freed from the linearprogramming of the physical
          brain, I could read each structure in itsentirety instantly, simultaneously
          appreciating its substance andessence. It was impossible not to marvel at
          these magnificent edifices,their monumental construction and seductive
          three-dimensionalpattern of beguiling symmetry, colour and proportions, woven
          togetherwith celestial craftsmanship, radiating out from their
          mysteriouscentres.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here on this level, thinking was no longer an effort but animmense pleasure of
          observation and detached contemplation, whichmade it easy to observe the
          limitations of thoughts themselves. Fromup here I had a perfect viewpoint. I
          could zoom in to them and absorbthem instantly in their essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was in philosopher's paradise. The world of human mind. Theheaven of
          inventors, artists, mathematicians, scientists and religiousbelievers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt great freedom in the exploration. Each structure had areason to be and
          to exist, just like any other creature in the world; theywere products of our
          species, borne out of need and the desire forknowledge and understanding. They
          were the songs of our thirstingsouls.
        </p>

        <h3 id="the-infinite-vistas">The infinite vistas of paradise</h3>
        <p>
          The journey unfoldsA gentle voice, which I at first mistook for a song,
          whispered into myear and prised me from my contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Look upon this playground of the mind. I dare you not to beseduced by it. In
          all your dreams you won't find greater amusementthan this.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This gentle voice was posing a question and was attempting, byits very
          gentleness, to demolish the world I had began to admire so
        </p>
        <p>
          much for its sheer grandiosity. The imperfections of what I saw beganto lose
          their power to seduce. I felt sorry for my fellow souls, who were
        </p>
        <p>
          trapped in them, forever seeking comfort and identity. I could seeclearly how
          passionately they would defend their positions, arguingtheir point of reality
          - they would even go to war for it. I studied theirirreconcilable differences
          of frequencies and character. Often theirauthority was taken only from their
          size, sometimes from the beauty oftheir design. It was clear that there could
          be no clear winner. All theirpassengers were attached to their systems rather
          than the reality oftheir own individual being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt_a rush of wind, as if I was flying through the air at greatspeed, but I
          was not moving. I heard distant thunder. The worldaround me began to shift and
          I wondered what other sights lay in storefor me. The wind was actually a
          familiar voice whispering gently intomy ear. I could not tell the words - it
          was a different language, nothuman. But somehow I had the impression of what
          it meant: it wasannouncing that I should prepare myself to visit the
          penultimate dreamof all humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thunder was accompanied by electrical activity around me.With a thrill I
          felt the huge lotus flower underneath me growingrapidly, spreading out in
          every direction until it formed the shell of anenormous celestial structure,
          large enough to contain the wholeuniverse. Ihad taken residency inside a grand
          cosmic temple. The wallswere made out of liquid light, continually solidifying
          and transforminginto new precious materials, beaming with ever changing
          patterns. Icould see at once where the architects of the great mosques on
          earthhad received their inspiration from.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every direction was an entrance or an exit, yet eachtantalisingly close by.
          Through each gigantic portal I could glance intothe vast vistas of different
          heavens, infinite landscapes lining the manyavenues leading out through the
          gates. Each route out of this cathedralwas a highway into another heaven,
          lined by magnificent arches as if toglorify the approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The walls of this enormous edifice were cycling through preciousmaterials,
          casting off energies in the forms of light and patterns ofalternating
          complexities, like a giant exotic sea creature. The temple, ifthis word is at
          all appropriate, was alive and was illuminated bycountless little orbs like
          myself. They sparkled in different colours andpermutations of expression, some
          bright, some calm and sedate, but
        </p>
        <p>
          each one individual. Streams of them migrated joyfully through thevast gates
          to disappear into their heavens. On closer inspection, I sawthat most of them
          were still attached to shapes which they had claimedfor themselves in their
          own worlds, fascinated by their power and
        </p>
        <p>
          drawing strength from them. It were these thought forms they werestill
          attached to, which would determine the nature of the heaven they
        </p>
        <p>
          would enter. It was clear to me that from each orb’s point of view theymust
          have felt that they alone formed the centre of this sheer endlessplace, and
          that their chosen heaven was the true destiny for every otherperson on Earth.
          It was easy to see why, because each formed the centrefrom which the cosmic
          lotus flower radiated out, and each formed thepetal of the adjacent one so
          that the whole merged into an infinitetapestry.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Humans find their identities here. They spin their webs ofphilosophies,
          religions and beliefs. Some get caught in it like a fly in aspider's web; some
          use it to spin their dreams and spend manylifetimes to unravel and fulfill
          them.” The voice whispered to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my attention had already wandered towards one of thosehovering portals.
          The temptation to explore one of these vistas wasoverwhelming. The mere
          thought was enough to overpower me, and Ientered one of the irresistible
          tunnels, which was huge and bright, andlined with impressive columns on either
          side, and above and below.Peering through the columns as I travelled along, I
          saw the sceneryspread out infinitely and I could have taken any of those side
          openingpathways and entered a new heaven of staggering diversity andwonder.
          People here could spent eternity exploring these fantasticheavenly universes,
          experiencing their never-ending joys andfreedoms, not getting tired or bored
          for a single moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found myself accelerating through the vaulted tunnels.Occasionally, I
          drifted past hosts of heavenly creatures like schools offish, rejoicing in
          song, On all sides new realms opened up like galaxies.T glanced into openings
          into other worlds, each one as vast as the one Itravelled through, promising
          unimaginable pleasures. I was lured fromall sides by fine soprano voices,
          which combined with all the otherjoyous songs creating a complete symphony. It
          was surely here, Imused, that our great Earthly composers received their
          inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I sailed straight on, past all of these temptations, which couldnot
          satisfy my hope that there was something more profound than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly there was a pull from another direction. It was I,myself. I realised
          that I had been seduced by a dream, a mere wish,which was only a thought, a
          possibility, and that reality was far morethan this. I was back in the temple.
          The voice spoke to me again, softly,gently, as if not to disturb my
          contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You are right. This world is a grand illusion, put in your path totrick you -
          to keep you fascinated and imprisoned as a limited being.
        </p>
        <p>Yet to many people on Earth what you’ve just seen is the dream of all</p>
        <p>dreams come true, the heaven of all heavens. And indeed, compared to</p>
        <p>
          life on the dense Earth, this truly is paradise, where people spend{-
          Millennia exploring the vast scope and vistas of heaven and its joys.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice now sounded more human and very close by. I wasbeing guided by a
          very old friend, who faded in and out of my vision.One moment it was a
          brilliant orb of light and the next a beautiful facematerialised, sculpted by
          a serene sense of humor, boundlesscompassion and love. Then it faded again,
          revealing itself as a presence,extending and merging with the surrounding
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stillness and peace that followed was an indication thatsomething was
          going to happen. Then I noticed that the silence was notsilence at all, but
          was a sound I had had no facility to hear before. Adeep boom gave me to
          understand immediately that all I had seen sofar was child’s play, that it was
          time to wake up out of my dream andembrace reality.

          Until now we have been dealing with dimensions, which, although difficultto
          describe or imagine, are still within the realms of our human experience,
          amental realm. The difficulty we are faced with in reaching into thedimensions
          beyond are that we are leaving the realms of knowledge,imagination, thinking

        <p>
          degree that we are able to manifest the most sublime concepts of our
          intellectand weave structures of incredible complexities resulting in the
          mostfascinating and uplifting earthly and mental heavens imaginable. To
          reachbeyond all this the mind is nothing but a burden and an obstacle. In
          order toget close to our true nature, all form of thought must perish, and
          with it ouridentity as limited human entities. In its place a new illuminated
          mind takesup position. At the basis of all conventional thinking is an
          awareness of thefinite, Our mind is simply incapable of comprehending anything
          outside itsown nature. Although we may have words for it like eternity,
          infinity, God,universal consciousness and their like, they will never provide
          a true insightinto states of consciousness which go beyond thinking. This is
          the veryreason why the Buddha is silent. This should not distract us from the
          factthat this is a natural state of consciousness which lies at the heart of
          all of us,in our innermost being. As such it can be called upon by way of
          attention.‘And we don’t have to be great sages to claim our natural heritage
          as thefollowing experience will illustrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulty though remains, it is almost impossible to conveysomething that
          is beyond thoughts, word and our general means ofcommunication. In oder to
          convey the experience all I am left with are aroundabout descriptions of
          symptoms, residues I was left with and it is onlythese I can convey. This is
          as far as I can go.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The presence near me reassured me that I was safe, but that I wasembarking on
          a new dimension altogether for which there was noprecedence. The sound I heard
          was like the OM®. I had used it in thepast while out of my body and now I
          realised why it had always hadsuch a powerful effect. But this was far, far
          more. It was the sound itselfmaking the sound, which was itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happened next was to challenge my human comprehensionto its limits.This
          was in unknown territory. I relied on the presence - which
        </p>
        <p>
          —was not human, yet like an old friend, a mother and father combined -to guide
          me. It was an incredibly intimate experience, and I was awareof it in my soul.
          I felt trust, absolute and unconditional - so much sothat I offered myself in
          total surrender to the presence.
        </p>
        <p>230Misa mantra used in eastern mysticism, the sound of creation.</p>
        <p>
          The world around me faded. The sound transmuted into thebreaking surf of ocean
          waves.
        </p>
        <p>It was born.</p>
        <p>Istood on the shores of a vast and glorious ocean.</p>
        <p>
          Real ocean waves are made of atoms and light, this ocean wasjust pure light in
          essence - as was the sandy beach; and the waves camerolling in towards me as
          gigantic mountains of crashing light,overwhelming me completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to put it like this is to do it a tremendous injustice, becausewords
          cannot describe the transformation which took place inside meas these energies
          burst into creation and into life, submerging anddissolving me in the process.
          But these are the limits of my words, andyou, the reader, will have to search
          deep within yourself to perhapstecall the distant memory when you too bathed
          in the water of life -before you were born into earthly existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘There was no fear, because there was only light, and the wavesthat rolled
          towards me crashed through me, lifting me into anunknown ecstasy, There was no
          letting up: wave after wave rolled overme and when I thought I could stand no
          more a greater joy swallowedme up and carried me with it into lands of bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as I said, this was not a place for words. Words belong to a farlower
          level of consciousness than even thought, and I had left thoughtslong behind
          in a universe which appeared now like dense darkness ofignorance in comparison
          to this. Thoughts are simply of a nature toogross, I realised - too coarse to
          touch the fabric of the matter tearing andhammering at my soul. There were
          universes upon universes, each onecreated by a crashing wave and each one
          ripped away and destroyedby the next, There was no repetition of universes;
          everything was newat every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          T then realised that everything that had happened was a processof purification
          of cosmic proportions. When the tide ebbed away therewas immense peace.
          Nothing stirred, nothing interrupted it. Until nowThad always been aware in my
          life of potentiality. This was potentialrealised to perfection. But there was
          far far more. All stress, all need
        </p>
        <p>
          and want had gone, everything I had strived for had found fulfillment.Whatever
          I wanted lay there before me in its absolute essence, in totalstillness and
          emptiness combined. But again, of course, the word
        </p>
        <p>
          emptiness is wrong. I had ceased to be. This was unformed, anunmanifested
          thrill. Until now I had been bathed in something whichcould be understood as
          the cradle or essence of love, but this was farbeyond that. It was a
          super-dimension of choice-less love, which was asclear as crystal. All
          remotely human feelings had been stripped from itand replenished with utter
          purity. It was pure intelligence, pureconsciousness. It was reality in
          essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew everything, because I was everything. No instrument ofknowledge was
          needed, because all instrumentality was my owncreation. No creation was
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>“Tam what I am.”</p>
        <p>“Lam.”</p>
        <p>
          I am all. Everyone of us can make these statements. We, as aspecies, are at
          the heart of creation in essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being is at the heart of reality throughout all dimensions and iscontained in
          every moment. It is here in its essence to be recalled at amoment's notice, no
          matter where we are, because it is the very bloodin our veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, stripped of all that I called myself, I was at the heart ofnature at its
          most powerful, most quintessential. I was omniscient,omnipresent and infinite.
          The instant a question was raised, myuniversal mind had it answered on a level
          unheard of, guided by auniversal wisdom, purpose and plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          When scientists finally probe into the last remaining mystery ofthe universe,
          this is what they will find and nothing will translate intomathematics,
          formulas or concepts. All this is vanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is life? A thin membrane stretched over a river of ecstasy.Once pierced
          your life will never be the same.
        </p>
        <p>I dared to raise a question.</p>
        <p>“What is to become of me, the creator?”</p>
        <p>
          Just when I thought there could be no answer to my question, Iheard new sounds
          rising from the stillness, like flutes opening a whiteinfinite space before me
          with shapes and possibilities undefined. Aninvitation to manifest within
          realms unknown, with adventures stillunrealised and untold.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is reality and truth. Man’s true evolution begins here, inpure clarity,
          free of all illusion. The future path of man’s destiny starts
        </p>
        <p>here, now, to enter dimensions yet incomprehensible and inaccessible,</p>
        <p>because man still carries the burden of his animal evolution and</p>
        <p>
          instincts to survive in a limited world. A few have stormed ahead toscout the
          way, to fathom what lies beyond.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I was only at the outer edges of creation and that beyondwaited
          dimensions too far beyond our human state of evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could travel no further, because this was my true home. I wasrocking gently
          to and fro to a celestial symphony, resting like a baby inits mother’s arms,
          in total trust and surrender, listening to the heartbeatof creation, which
          rolled through me in waves of ecstasy. I felt I couldtake no more and feared
          that if I stayed on I would surrender my veryconsciousness and lose myself in
          the infinite ocean of pure joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 did not want this. I had worked for many years to attainSamadhi and when it
          came I was unprepared. I had to return.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot say how long I was in this region. I felt sanctified.Everything about
          and around me was beautified. I felt whole andholiness was a word which had
          attained its true meaning for me now.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I came round I was sitting on a bench in a large hall, stillnot in my
          physical body. My face rested in my hands. I was in a state ofrecovery,
          adjustment. My body convulsed with the aftereffects of this
        </p>
        <p>
          { experience. I tried to control them and get a grip of the thing I
          calledmyself, a curious entity thrown together with molecules and atomsmined
          from eternity and infinity and endowed with a unit ofconsciousness which could
          call itself “me”. Now it was dressed againin ideas, protecting itself for
          whatever reason from the light of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iam, But what was this ‘I am’, separated from its true reality. Itwas nothing
          but a thought, a dream, an illusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tbecame gradually aware of my surroundings and noticed a mansitting on another
          bench not far from me. He looked vaguely familiar,but I could not place him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Have you been through that door?” he asked, pointing at amagnificent entrance
          to some other room. “You could not have,” hesaid then, answering his own
          question. “Ihave been sitting and waitinghere for years and years. You are not
          that advanced to go through thatdoor.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I had little idea what he was talking about, but I guessed hemeant the
          dimension I had just returned from, that heavenly realm hehad been waiting to
          get into for so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          T looked at him. I had nothing to reply with - no words to say orthink with. I
          still saw what I had seen behind my eyes and my heartwas struggling to adjust,
          still reeling in the aftermath of such bliss.There was nobody to convince, no
          tales to be told, no witness to bringforward. I knew that it was pointless to
          talk about it. I felt sorry for allthose who may have tried, who fell victim
          to being misunderstood,their listeners mistaking them for saints, turning them
          into prophetsand holy men. I wanted nothing to do with this and had no
          interest inconvincing anybody. That which pulsated through my veins
          pulsatedthrough everybody's. Each one of us is, in that regard, a
          saint,sanctified; each one of us is blessed by our great heritage. I took
          peaceand comfort in the fact that I was like everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I looked at the man in front of me I wanted to say, “Don’twait and don’t
          try; you are already there.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at me. Then I noticed other people, a group crowdingaround me, but
          it wasn’t me they were crowding around - it was a manby my side, who I
          recognised as a master and a friend. It was he who
        </p>
        <p>
          s=-had been with me and had escorted me into the dimension I had justreturned
          from.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned towards me and said chirpily: “Its time to go. Saygoodbye to the
          chappy with the great golden key.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I burst out laughing, because I realised he was referring to themythological
          keeper of Heaven's Gate, St. Peter of the Christian faith. Iwas happy to be
          human again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other people in the group were laughing and making flippant,disrespectful,
          human comments. The great master made me appreciatehow natural it was to enter
          into such a state.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our group went through the great hall we passed gigantictapestries. This
          was a true palace with huge arched ceilings andmarbled floors and walls, but
          of such abundance and craftsmanshipthat they could only be fashioned in
          thought. People of our group werepointing and talking. After a while we passed
          enormous windows andI looked out into wide open country. We descended many
          flights of
        </p>
        <p>
          stairs. The master asked questions, but I was still too preoccupied withwhat I
          had seen to pay much attention to them. The next time I lookedout of the
          window I saw a sky covered with silver cloud. Theatmosphere had become
          distinctly Earthly. I could see numerous riverssnaking across the countryside,
          and many people working. I sawbulldozers and bizarre heavy machinery and
          wondered about themeaning of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The master noticed my puzzlement, He asked if I could explainwhat I was
          seeing,
        </p>
        <p>I said, "Judging by the clouds and the light in the sky and the use</p>
        <p>|| of such heavy machinery, I'd say we must be on a dimension very close</p>
        <p>
          | to our Earth.” The master laughed approvingly. It was strange thatdespite
          his familiarity and friendliness I could not work out where Iknew him from,
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we exited the building and the group dispersed. Iwatched the workmen
          having fun with their equipment by stagingplay fights, clashing their diggers
          against each other, yelling andlaughing like schoolboys.
        </p>
        <p>
          knew it was time to go back to my own familiar territory. I spenta few moments
          running through the events, knowing that withoutimpressing them on my brain
          all I had experienced would be lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I woke up I was slumped over in my chair. I ran once again[ through the
          events, without moving a muscle. The inside of my head felt likea brightly
          illuminated hall. I sat in total peace, reliving it all. There was astrong
          light right at the top of my skull. I smirked when the thought of acartoon
          light bulb slipped into my mind. “To see the light’ is an expression weall
          take for granted, but why don’t we remember what the light is? I relishedthe
          fact that what I had seen was real, not a dream.Finally, I got up out of my
          chair. It was just after eight in the morning.Julia was still asleep, and she
          looked very peaceful. I peeked into my littledaughter's room, where she lay
          nestled up in her cot.What a miracle creation is, I thought.Imade tea. I got
          dressed. I felt different.‘There was a presence with me, which I had carried
          back into my worldfrom that other dimension. It showed there was continuity to
          life, whichspans all levels of consciousness. The presence was with me as I
          left the
        </p>
        <p>
          house, when I crossed the road and walked to the nearby cricket ground.When_I
          acknowledged the presence with a smile, it smiled back at metenfold. I felt
          warmth and affection for it, and it responded withoverwhelming love. I felt
          privileged to be have been chosen to be alive, tocontinue to be allowed to
          live in a universe of such splendor. The presencewas with me like a silent
          companion. It watched my every step. It walkedwith me and everywhere I looked
          I saw it. It confirmed its reality. Everyhumble tree or object I looked at
          told me that it was true.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world had a wonderful symmetry. The songs of the birds blendedharmoniously
          with the noise of a passing car and the slight breeze rustlingthe branches of
          the trees. My eyes naturally picked out repeating pattern onthe tarmac of the
          path in front of me, reassembling it like a Persian carpet.This is a beautiful
          place, I thought, and as humans we are chosen to share itwith its creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, our physical brain is a powerful organ, rooted firmly in our
          three-dimensional world. However lofty our experiences, they cannot stand
          theirground in the harsh light of man-made reality, and soon my journal
          entrywas filed under ‘Extraordinary Experiences’ and left there for
          twenty-five ]years, It took allthis time and regular deep meditation to coax
          this presence |subtly and gradually back into my life as a silent reality.

        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <h3>What is reality?</h3>
        <p>
          If some reputable scientists were to say, “I am very sorry, but you
          aremistaken. We have conclusive proof that what you experienced and whatyou
          have recorded in your journals is nothing more than one big illusion, afigment
          of your imagination,” then my answer would probably be, “thankyou for telling
          me; I have suspected it myself for a long time now, but wouldyou mind
          including my physical experiences as well?”
        </p>
        <p>
          One may wonder whether visits to, or ‘visions’ of, other dimensions,like in
          the previous chapter, however real when experienced, hold anysignificance for
          our life in the physical reality at all. I suspect that they mayhave a similar
          relevance as music and art has. It was a vision, an event in mylife long gone,
          and yet it was nothing less than reality proper, reality in itsessence. It is
          with me wherever I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          It proved to me that at the core of all experience lies an inner reality,which
          is pure and universal. But the most important realisation is that onedoes not
          have to scale the highest mountain or zoom through multipledimensions to find
          it. It is here with us now. The fact that we exist is proofenough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reality is a strange thing and as a species we have an ambiguousrelationship
          with it. Yet it is the only thing that counts in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can divide the people who have a good grip on reality into fourcategories:
          they are either very rich, very successful or very happy, or allthree of
          these. If we tune into reality we acquire the best possible ways forsurvival
          by considering facts and the laws of nature, society, economy and allthe other
          rules that govern our lives. Ironically though, however rich or
        </p>
        <p>
          successful or happy we may be, if we don’t grasp reality at its core we
          stillwon't live in a real world and will most probably be left wanting more.
          Wehaven't arrived at the real wealth and the real success in our lives
          andconsequently still feel lacking. Without a foundation in its essence, the
          realitywe perceive is no more than a deception.
        </p>
        <p>
          A revolution is taking place, a paradigm shift in consciousness. Nature'sway
          of digging us out of our hole is by shifting our universal awareness to anew
          level. Mankind is waking up to the reality at the core level to save
          itselffrom self-destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are becoming aware of the present, the now, because it is here thatwe start
          controlling our world and our destiny as a species.
        </p>
        <p>
          The awakening to the reality of the present is a global phenomena.Mankind is
          rising from its dream. Nothing less than our survival is at stake.We are
          awakening from our madness of self-destruction and beginning to seewho we
          really are and what creates our world. Until now we relied on beliefsand
          hearsay instead of awareness of what is in order to make sense of theworld.
        </p>
        <p>
          Countless religions and belief systems have been created to serve us thetruth
          like a ready made dish. Once one meal has been consumed thenanother one is
          served immediately, because our minds can never be satisfied.Alll theory,
          religion and philosophy has a limited shelf life.

          Beliefs are rigid and we have witnessed societies crumble that werebuilt on
          ideas. Scientific beliefs and hypothesis fare no better. The little weknow is
          called quickly into question and is replaced by something more‘fundamental’.
          But scientists, too, are awakening and beginning to realisethat the ultimate
          truth or theory of everything cannot be found within theconfines of an
          external reality, because the external world has long mergedwith our minds.
          This has turned out to be our great illusion, because we seeourselves divorced
          from the world. Scientists with fresh minds will soonbegin to explore the next
          dimension from within them and then begin to diga tunnel from both ends until
          the next dimension becomes our new frontier.

          New modes of operation are being deployed and they can only befound in the
          present. Nothing else is dynamic enough. Nothing else holds thepower to unlock
          the great remaining mysteries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until now we despaired when our beliefs crumbled in the face ofTeality, but
          soon we will see only our liberation. The present can’t crumble.All we need to
          do is to surrender to its reality: the now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment we submit to the present our new consciousness makesreality the
          most beautiful part of being human, and living in a physicaldimension becomes
          a great privilege. We meet challenges with eagerness,keen to learn, to
          progress, to satisfy our need to pursue our potential, toadjust and to create
          for ourselves a beautiful and ever-changing world, Weare facing up to reality
          as a training ground for our evolution. We have tiredof trying to escape from
          it. We are realising that our creeds have run theircourse and our escape
          strategies and our addiction to beliefs are shallow and
        </p>
        <p>empty.</p>
        <p>
          We are discovering that the reason for our unhappiness is that we areout of
          touch with reality. We are beginning to redefine our lives in thiscomplex
          world until it becomes simple and authentic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adapting our strategies to be dynamic has become essential for oursurvival in
          the physical world, but most of all we are learning how to BE inthe PRESENT.
          We don’t need books or any teachers to tell us how to wake upfrom our dreams
          in the morning and we won't be needing books when wewake in our new
          consciousness. We will simply step into a new awareness ofthe present and
          realise that it was, is, always here. :
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not cut off cells, but constituent parts of a gigantic universal=
          organism which always was, always is and always will be, because that is the
        </p>
        <p>
          very nature of the present, which is with us NOW. How can we notsurrender to
          it? It is the greater part of us, tuned in to our innermost nature,supporting
          us as we go about living. We can never be alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every moment is new. Every morning we get up is a new experience.There is no
          repetition. The present becomes our presence, our friend, a latentecstasy
          ready to pour itself into our hearts at the slightest provocation. Aspace of
          infinite peace and inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people who experience it choose to call it God. That's OK,because you
          don’t need to believe in God any longer. If God does not presentitself, then
          people call on ‘faith’ or ‘belief’ and only confirm their separationfrom it.
          Belief has no part of the new consciousness - experience andrealisation is
          taking its place.
        </p>

          We are all standing at the platform waiting for our train to arrive to takeus
          to the next dimension. All life is about death. Death is always lurking inthe
          background. But because we are accustomed to seeing it as an end to liferather
          than a new beginning we stare at it with trepidation and associate it
        </p>
        <p>
          with dread and fear. The Buddhist idea to a happy life is to embrace
          deathevery day with joyful anticipation, because in reality death is just
          anotherthing that happens on our long journey through eternal life. Every day
          weare moving closer towards the door, beyond which a new life of
          greatadventure, new opportunities and mystery awaits us. Imagine a life
          withoutfear and full of joyful anticipation, where every day presents us with
          anotheropportunity to prepare ourselves for a greater life. All our dreams
          will cometrue, our greatest ambitions realised. The moment we allow
          joyfulanticipation to rule our hearts and lives we open ourselves to the
          present andbreach the great divide. We don’t even have to wait for our big day
          to arrive.Itis here already - now - every moment. Fear is not part of it, only
          joy and theecstasy of the moment. We have nothing to fear, because reality is
          eternal,timeless and limitless. When all our thoughts have taken their
          allocated* places to serve and not to control us, only silence remains, and it
          will take us
        </p>
        <p>
          to our true home.By surrendering to the present, we will all realise our
          universal nature
        </p>
        <p>and become true multidimensional beings.</p>
