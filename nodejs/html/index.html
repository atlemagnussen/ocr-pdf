<p>Life in other dimensionsAncient masters</p>
<p>
  Thad experienced so much, but now I was keenly aware of my limitations. Iwas
  on the threshold of a world which was far greater than I had hithertoexplored.
  I knew beyond doubt that there were even more extraordinaryworlds out there -
  dimensions that lay at the heart of all human dreams anddesires. I was
  frustrated by the fact that I had no means with which topenetrate deeper. I
  needed help.
</p>
<p>
  All I could do was stick to my meditation routine. I had grown tired ofreading
  books on anything to do with spirituality and yearned for first-handknowledge.
  I had no time for teachers, authors, religions, philosophies oranything
  spiritual at all. I measured everything by an experience I had hadmany years
  ago which I am about to relate - one which told me that the onlyguidance I
  could trust had to come from within myself.
</p>
<p>
  So far, meditation had given me a means to connect, had given mesovereignty
  and confidence and inspiration. Ideas were no substitute forexperience. I knew
  ideas, whether scientific, religious or philosophical, neverworked in the long
  run and were too static to adapt to the reality of auniverse in a state of
  continual change. It was this ever-changing reality ofthe ‘now’ which I found
  most attractive in life - the uncertainty and theadventure it harboured. It
  was the heartbeat of my life; reality was my keymantra. The idea of ‘God’ was
  unacceptable because it was burdened withother people‘s meanings.
</p>
<p>
  Despite rejecting anything that I considered external, I had yearnedsecretly
  for some direction for a long time now; but it had to be
  firsthand,unprocessed, authentic and original. But yearn as I might, I
  received nothingfrom within.
</p>
<p>
  In my meditation I tried to unite the observer with the observed, to
  gainsingularity and the exalted state of consciousness, which I knew to
  existbecause I had experienced it once before when it had taken hold of me. It
  hadwalked beside me as a silent presence ever since.
</p>
<p>
  When this presence entered my life I had been meditating for severalyears
  while studying fine art in Hamburg in the early seventies. Everymorning | got
  up at the crack of dawn and spent an hour in meditation, halfan hour
  practising yoga asanas, and then another two hours in meditation. 1established
  a routine of four to five hours each day for nearly a year, butnothing
  happened. Inside was darkness: no revelations were forthcoming,and most of the
  time I struggled to overcome other thoughts and foughtagainst sleep. In the
  end I became irritable, frustrated to the point ofresentment and anger. I
  decided to drop the whole meditation Jark as apointless fantasy and instead
  devoted all my time to enjoying my student lifeto the full.
</p>
<p>
  I lived in a small student flat at that time. My ascetic lifestyle wasreplaced
  by a modest form of hedonism, limited only by the fact that I wasquite poor.
  Every Wednesday, across the road from where I lived was a smallmarket. I made
  it a habit to buy bread, cheese and fruit there. I wasparticularly fond of the
  fresh, slightly sour rye bread and the strong Tilsitercheese, which I bought
  every week from the same woman. It became a ritualto brew myself a big mug of
  very strong black coffee and tuck into breadwith cheese for breakfast before
  going to college.
</p>
<p>‘This morning was no exception.</p>
<p>
  I cut two inches off the end of my loaf of bread and withoutbuttering it,
  topped it with a half-inch slice of cheese. I tucked into myfeast like a
  starving caveman, slurping the hot black coffee from myhuge mug. I enjoyed the
  fact that nobody was watching and that I was,able to satisfy my appetite in
  the way only animals knew how.
</p>
<p>
  Then, when I launched into a massive second bite, somethingextraordinary
  happened.
</p>
<p>— became aware.</p>
<p>
  I lowered my sandwich. I felt as if someone had switched offtime. I saw how
  crude I looked stuffing my face and satisfying my baseinstincts. I had lost my
  relationship with my sandwich and my mug ofcoffee.
</p>
<p>a aMultidimensional Man</p>
<p>I lowered my cup. Somehow it did not belong to me anymore;</p>
<p>nor did my hands. It all belonged to someone else. Then there was</p>
<p>
  ~ stillness, like a warm blanket - but it had a presence: it spoke to
  mewithout words: “There you are.”
</p>
<p>
  It was not a voice. It was an acknowledgment that I existed. Itwelcomed me to
  join every other atom in the universe. Until now, I hadnever considered one
  simple fact; 1 was,
</p>
<p>
  The noise from the traffic outside my window had stopped.Everything - the
  whole world - was quiet, as if to draw attention to thismoment. This stillness
  was not merely an absence of sound, it wasstillness which told me: “I am the
  stillness which allows sound to be ifit pleases me.”
</p>
<p>It was a stillness which was a presence, but it was not a life form.</p>
<p>“Iam. I give life to everything. I give life to you.”</p>
<p>
  On understanding the profundity that I had been created, I wasoverwhelmed
  instantly by a huge wave of gratitude. I felt honoured,and sanctified -
  privileged that I existed. But this was not all.
</p>
<p>“Come to me and I will show you who you really are.”</p>
<p>
  Thad no option of resisting, because the room around me filledwith a blazing
  light. Everything burst into millions of atoms and raineddown on me as an
  unbearable blessing. For a moment my bodyconvulsed in ecstatic bliss, but then
  it was shed like a useless garmentand I stood clear and without any attributes
  in an inferno of ecstatic joy.
</p>
<p>“Now there is nothing left of your being.”</p>
<p>
  With this realisation booming through an infinite realm ofbeingness, the
  ecstatic joy was stripped from me as well, and then therewas nothing. All that
  was left was an ocean of clarity. A cosmic sea ofpure intelligence - the
  essence of being.
</p>
<p>
  “You cannot grasp who I am, or who you are, and nor can youunderstand. We are
  both of the same, beyond understanding.”
</p>
<p>
  Then everything stopped. There was nothing to describe what Ihad become aware
  of. It was neither good nor bad, neither love nornon-love. There was not an
  emotion or any feeling or thought thatcould be attributed to it. It was purely
  neytral. It was immeasurableclarity."This is truth. There is nothing else
  beside it. Nothing to attainand nothing to gain. Truth, clear and without
  attributes or purposeother than to be. Nothing else is real.”
</p>
<p>For what seemed like hours I was tossed and torn through</p>
<p>
  — incredible vistas of being with billions of different nuances
  andappearances, all sprung from the same source. I was sucked deeper anddeeper
  into an unbearable glory and then tossed out again to be toldthat all glory is
  an illusion. I took on the shapes of infinite diversity,spreading forever
  throughout the far-flung realms of creation; but itwas just a dream compared
  to the clear light, which stood still andpassionless, embracing and filling
  all forms. And at every moment Irealised the stillness in everything,
  peaceful, kind, generous and lovingand yet unknowable.
</p>
<p>
  c The bright light began to mellow. It left a warm, extremelycomforting and
  reassuring glow, not at all like the brilliant claritywhich I had experienced
  before. My room descended into the darknessof the bright summer daylight. The
  atoms began to reassemble the
</p>
<p>
  world around me, including my body. I was back, but it wasn’t me whowas back.
  The other me, which was clinging to its tiny heap of brokenflesh, fell onto
  the ground and cried like a small and helpless child. Istood beside it.
</p>
<p>
  C “You are fine,” I said to the child lying on the floor and
  sobbinginconsolably. “Everything will be alright.”
</p>
<p>
  That was two years before my first out-of-body experience, but the‘presence’
  had remained with me ever since, though I have neverexperienced it as clearly
  as on that day. I began my meditation again shortlyafter, more in homage and
  to say thank you than to achieve anything with it.
</p>
<p>
  At times it would pop up unannounced and walk beside me. Iacknowledged it
  without making a fuss and told no-one. Sometimes it wason the ground, or the
  wooden fence I walked past. Sometimes it was the bigheavy metal train and the
  rusty railway line. Always, it departed withoutgreat show. I knew it was there
  even if I couldn't see it. I dared not give it aname because it was too
  subtle, too fleeting, and yet it was everything therewas. I dared not give it
  a thought in order not to taint it.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Two years later, the out-of-body events happened, a fluke of nature,never the
  objective of my meditation - a rather non-essential by-product. I
</p>
<p>
  employed no techniques geared towards separation, because that wasn’t
  thepoint. Nevertheless, I was fascinated, obsessed even. It was as if fate
  hadhanded me a great adventure book to read. I had to explore.
</p>
<p>
  But now I was adrift, knowing neither where to proceed nor what toachieve. But
  I sensed that out-of-body journeys were a platform from whichto travel within
  myself - to gain new insight and understanding; to reach newlevels of
  awareness.
</p>
<p>
  I was on virgin territory and I did not know where to turn. I neededhelp.
  Finally, it came.
</p>
<p>Meeting the Master</p>
<p>
  18th July 1977Early morning meditation. After working through what I describe
  asthe goo-state of consciousness - a trancelike semi-dream state, ladenwith
  heavy images and visions - my mind began to clear abruptly as Ientered a state
  of great clarity. I was completely detached from mybody, and I rose up into a
  brilliant blue sky while chanting my mantra.The force pulling me higher and
  higher was a strange combination ofyearning and joy which I felt at rising
  into a heavenly sky. But it didn’tlast. No matter how hard I tried I could not
  rise above a certain height.‘The frustration made me descend to the ground
  again, feelingabandoned and unworthy, excluded from the prospect of
  reachingbeyond my limitations. When I abandoned these negative feelings
  andstarted focusing on the mantra again I rose up once more, only to
  sinktowards the ground with my concentration faltering.
</p>
<p>
  In a final effort to break through the barriers I shouted into thedeepening
  blue above me for help, clinging desperately to my mantra,but I found myself
  yet again descending back to earth, lonely anddejected. Confronted with the
  unending cycle of rising and falling andconceding the limitations of my power,
  all I could do in the end was tosurrender and let go of my ambition and
  desires. I drifted down toearth like a leaf from its branch, until finally I
  landed softly on theground. It was a forest floor.
</p>
<p>
  T rose to my feet and started walking to find out where I was andperhaps a way
  out of it. I came to a clearing, and instinct told me tostop. I found myself
  staring at a space about ten feet in front of me.
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly, out of midair, four strange ted objects appeared. I couldn’tidentify
  what they were at first; absurdly enough, the thought occurredthat they could
  be socks, until I saw them taking the shape of Chinesesilk or paper lanterns,
  forming a perfect rectangle.
</p>
<p>
  This strange spectacle had a magical effect on me and I stared atthe square
  with fascination. There was a presence about this whichprevented me from
  withdrawing my attention and for some time I juststood and stared in
  curiosity, wondering what sort of magic was goingto take place.
</p>
<p>Suddenly I knew this was going to be a very special event. I was</p>
<p>
  — about to meet_a great person: an ancient master_and_a_wise_man.Although I
  couldn’t see him, he was already there, announcing hisarrival invisibly. I
  could feel a powerful presence. My heart startedbeating faster and with a
  strange mixture of joy, dread and expectationIsstared into the centre of the
  magical square.
</p>
<p>The lanterns dissolved into the air and in their place I observed</p>
<p>
  the gradual appearance of an enigmatic figure, not standing as onemight, but
  propped casually on his elbow in a half-sitting position withhis hands folded
  over his stomach, one knee bent and the other legoutstretched,
</p>
<p>
  He wore a modest gown, but his face showed a character andcharisma I have
  rarely seen before: it was lined by a habitual expressionof humour and
  good-naturedness. He was Chinese in origin andbeamed at me cheerfully, totally
  at ease.
</p>
<p>
  Irecognised him. I had known him all my life - no, for all eternity.I felt the
  thrill of a long-wished for reunion. Finally, after years ofstruggle,
  searching for assistance with my yoga practice, he had cometo answer my call.
  I was overwhelmed, humbled and honoured at thesame time. I threw myself in
  front of the great being and touched hisfeet.
</p>
<p>
  The Chinese master laughed and kicked me gently. “Can youimagine how
  ridiculous you would look if someone strolled past andsaw you touching my
  feet?”
</p>
<p>
  He was an old friend. When he spoke to me his words were fullof enlightened
  humour and wonderful gentleness. I can’t remember allcof what he said, but
  each word had a powerful effect on me, reachingright into the core of my
  being.While I was kneeling in front of him, he kicked me gently with> his bare
  foot every time he wanted to emphasise a point. Gradually, hiskicks assumed a
  more regular circular movement on my chest; theyturned into a rhythmic massage
  around my heart. Every time I felt thepressure my heart burned as if a fire
  had been lit; his movements werefanning the flames until I could hardly bear
  it. The fire spread thoughmy whole body. I was consumed by a strange
  combination of pleasureand pain.
</p>
<p>
  Then, unexpectedly, out of the corner of my eye I saw Juliaapproaching us. My
  attention to what he was saying slippedmomentarily. Julia spoke to me, but I
  was trying to re-grasp what themaster was saying, so I apologised and asked
  him to repeat what hehad just told me. He winked at me and laughed. “You_are
  easilydistracted by a beautiful woman and equally easily lost withinyourself,
  so that you miss all the good things.”
</p>
<p>
  I knew he was right. Lack of attention was one of my greatestchallenges. I
  felt embarrassed. He spoke again, but what he said isdifficult to put into
  words. He sent me images like riddles, and Iunderstood the symbolic meaning
  instantly, realising that words couldnever contain the wealth of information
  that these symbols could. Oneimage he sent me, with a broad smile, contained
  three pieces of cake.
</p>
<p>“It's a piece of cake,” I heard him think jokingly.</p>
<p>
  One piece was whole, the second was almost cut and the thirdwas cut into two
  pieces. At the same time he sent me an image ofChristmas and awakened in me
  the memory of an almost childlikeexpectation of Christmas. I understood that
  the three pieces of cakerepresented three events, The whole piece of cake
  represented theanticipation of a great event, the second piece the experience
  of a greatevent and the cut piece the passing of the event.
</p>
<p>
  “Which of these events would require your greatest attention?”he asked with a
  smile.
</p>
<p>
  After a little hesitation I pointed to the piece of cake which wascut in half
  and answered, “If I treat all events as if they have alreadypassed, then I
  will never get attached to them and will always be free.” #
</p>
<p>
  My master nodded and chuckled and then closed his eyes as iflost in deep
  thought.
</p>
<p>
  I felt our reunion had come to an end. | felt like I had been with afriend, an
  equal, someone who would not dream of assuming asuperior role - someone of
  such modesty and absence of ego that thewhole universe rushed in to fill the
  space. His presence was not that ofa man but the presence of infinity itself.
  This was the greatest lesson Itook from our meeting. I looked at him again,
  one last time: he had notchanged his position for one moment. With his eyes
  closed he appearedto be in deep meditation, maybe even sleep. The thought
  amused me.For a second I remembered him as the old friend he once was and
  inlight banter I shouted.
</p>
<p>"Hey, you look almost dead.”</p>
<p>My friend opened his eyes and laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“Get away,” he yelled, and we both laughed. “I'll be seeing you.”</p>
<p>
  With this I rushed back into my body. When I opened my eyes, Iwas slumped
  forward with a burning feeling in my chest.
</p>
<p>The burning lasted for more than two weeks. Whenever I thought back</p>
<p>
  to that meeting it flared up as if somebody had set fire to my heart. At
  thesame time I was consumed with an ecstatic joy which would last for
  hourseach time.
</p>
<p>
  Pointers from another dimension29th September 1977+ After two months I met my
  Chinese master again. He greeted me witha broad grin and told me that he had
  another test for me, and heshowed me to a door in an open field. He said this
  test was veryimportant, because everything in life depends on it and that
  there wasonly one way to get through the door.
</p>
<p>
  With that, I was bombarded with a stream of images and symbolswhich I simply
  cannot put into words. It felt as if the symbols were partof a very compact
  language which was rooted in a higher dimension,too sublime and too complex to
  be translated into human language,and yet it felt as natural to me as everyday
  words,
</p>
<p>
  I passed through the door several times. Each time it would openonly when Ihad
  adopted the right attitude.
</p>
<p>
  I cannot tell how long my lesson lasted, but I was told that I hadpassed
  another important test, which would enable me reach muchfurther. But there
  were no goodbyes this time. My Chinese friend justvanished.
</p>
<p>The elusive Master</p>
<p>
  6th September 1977I became lucid almost as soon as I fell asleep. I used the
  ‘focusing on
</p>
<p>= the ground’ technique to achieve full waking consciousness. Julia was</p>
<p>
  with me. I was excited and attempted to help her achieve lucidity tooso that
  we could share our experience together and compare notesupon waking up. I
  talked her through the process of gaining lucidity byasking her to let the
  soil run through her fingers, to feel the sensation,to watch the little
  crystals and to hear the sound, but she didn’t seeminterested and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
  A moment later I looked around and found myself in a vast, longunearthly
  landscape, a huge valley surrounded by a massive mountainrange. There was a
  mist everywhere, not like cloud but sparkling like
</p>
<p>
  — opal. This had a strange effect on my feelings. I couldn't figure outwhether
  the mist was a result of my surroundings or of my emotions. Iwas mixed up
  intimately with my environment and it felt great. I wasoverwhelmed by a
  feeling of intense love which lifted me into the air,and the higher I rose the
  more intense the feeling became. It came inwaves and the only way of dealing
  with it was by allowing it to passstraight through me. The effect was that I
  lit up like a giant lightbulb,illuminating my surroundings. I felt utter
  bliss.
</p>
<p>
  I cannot remember how long I remained in this state, but I had adesire to
  contact the Chinese master again, more out of curiosity than ofneed.
</p>
<p>
  I focused my attention on the master while chanting the mantra,and with that I
  was swept off the ground and catapulted through theair. But the movement was
  inconsistent. The feeling of joy wasn’t thereany longer - I had to use the
  power of my mind to maintain movement,The environment started to change.
  Before long I looked down ontoblack and choppy ocean waters beneath me. Some
  waves rosefrighteningly into the air, higher and higher.
</p>
<p>
  Alarmingly, I lost altitude and was soon surrounded bymountainous waves on all
  sides. I darted in and out, avoiding thewater mountains, trying desperately to
  gain altitude, but the moreanxious I became the more I lost control until I
  plunged right into thesea. Fearing that I was about to drown I cried out for
  help. This was not
</p>
<p>
  z= a dream, but reality. I could feel the cold and the fear of doom. In
  adesperate effort I tried to gather my reasoning power to remind myselfthat I
  was in control, but the reality of the raging ocean around memade a mockery of
  the notion that I was in charge. I was tossed aroundviolently, overwhelmed by
  titanic forces that rendered me utterlyhelpless. With a last mighty effort,
  and with the desperation of adrowning man, I cried for help from my master.
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly, as if from nowhere, a ting was thrown over me and Iwas pulled
  towards a platform. On this pontoon stood a man, pulling‘me closer. I thought
  I recognised my Chinese friend, but as I got closer Inoticed that it was not
  the master I had hoped for at all - he was my oldreligious instruction teacher
  from school.
</p>
<p>
  “You wanted a master,” he said as I climbed onto the raft. “I amyour master.”
  He laughed out loud. I never liked this teacher and I wasdeeply disappointed.
  I made a strong effort of will until I opened myphysical eyes in my bed.
</p>
<p>
  I felt hurt, if not angry, lying in my bed with my eyes wide open.Then I saw
  the funny side. I had been teased because I had cried forhelp like a child,
  and what a great cruel joke and a splendid lesson itwas. Courage was needed to
  conquer these worlds. It was typical of myChinese friend to mock me and
  ridicule my weakness.
</p>
<p>Final Tests</p>
<p>
  8th of March 1980On the same morning I had visited myself in the life of the
  petty tyrant,Ilay in my bed with my eyes closed, still highly sensitised to
  the nextdimension. Even when I opened them I knew I could slip back
  intolucidity easily and leave my body: I still had the familiar sense of dual
  4awareness, which would allow me to transport myself to any part of Ithe
  universe on another dimension with an act of will. I felt confident=
</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man</p>
<p>
  that the whole universe was laid out before me to be explored and thatall I
  had to do was to decide where to go.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I plunged myself fully into the second state of awareness.This time I
  wanted to protect myself against the very real possibility ofbeing drawn back
  into the life of the petty tyrant. I decided to call forprotection and so I
  focused on my Chinese friend and master. Nosooner had I conjured up his image
  than was I catapulted into a strangeroom.
</p>
<p>Nothing was happening, but I knew I was about to be tested.</p>
<p>
  There was an element of occasion about this - as if my life was atstake, like
  a test of life and death.
</p>
<p>
  “Everything you have done so far has been a doddle,” I wasgiven to understand
  via a disembodied voice in my head, which Irecognised as that of my master.
  “But if you want to go further, you'llneed courage and lots of it.
  Unfortunately, you just act like a littlechild.”
</p>
<p>I was bewildered.</p>
<p>
  “This is not necessarily a bad thing,” he continued. “You can useyour
  childishness to your advantage.”
</p>
<p>
  I could sense his amusement and the familiar giggle, but I stillcould not see
  him. It didn’t stop him from lecturing me. I was told thatfear was a great
  obstacle in my quest and had no place in my life,neither on this level or any
  other.
</p>
<p>
  “To rid yourself of your fear, guilt and all those images that arehaunting you
  from your past, you will have to go back to the samestate of mind you had when
  you where a baby. Babies don’t have anyfear because they don’t carry any
  images around from the past andthey don’t have an idea of the future.”
</p>
<p>
  I was made to understand that the only way to rid myself of fear,guilt and all
  the past-life images that were haunting me was to appealto my childishness or,
  better, to a childlike innocence.
</p>
<p>
  I became aware that the room was a very dangerous place. Sodangerous in fact
  that I had to get out at all cost. Remaining there wouldhave meant a fate
  worse than I could imagine. The sum total of all mypast-life deeds and
  suffering would brew together and obliterate me.
</p>
<p>
  The room had one exit, but the frame of the doorway waspunctuated with dozens
  of holes. Out of each hole a sharp spearhead
</p>
<p>
  protruded, easing slowly in and out in a random manner as ifPreparing to
  strike anyone trying to escape the room.
</p>
<p>
  This is brilliant, I thought. I cannot stay and I cannot get out. 1 knewquite
  clearly that I had a third option: I could simply wake up, get outof bed, have
  a cup of tea and pretend it was all a dream. But I knewequally that this was
  not an option at all. What would happen herewould have an effect on my whole
  evolutional progress.
</p>
<p>
  “If you do not pass this test it is virtually pointless to carry onventuring
  into the next worlds. It will simply bore you out of your headto do so. There
  is nothing more to be gained.”
</p>
<p>
  As I pondered my options it became clear to me that there wereonly two ways of
  getting through the doorway. I remembered what itwas like to be a child with
  no fear of death, with the absoluteknowledge that I would be safe because I
  couldn't even conceive of thedanger.
</p>
<p>
  The second way was courage. The courage and fearlessness of apowerful warrior
  who was not afraid to die and could not conceive ofany enemy that could not be
  defeated, no matter how powerful he was.
</p>
<p>
  As I stared at the doorway, trying to conjure up innocence orheroism, I saw to
  my great surprise and amusement four people out ofnowhere strolling past me
  and straight though the door. It was such astark contrast to my trepidation
  that I burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
  “They don’t know of any danger, but you do,” the voicewhispered cheerfully
  into my ear. “Ignorance is bliss.”
</p>
<p>
  I pinned my eyes at the spears in the doorway, which were stilleasing in and
  out, set to impale their victims. I was back contemplatingmy two options.
</p>
<p>
  I remembered my early childhood, sitting on my mother’s lapand being told the
  fairy tale of the Wicked Witch and how she lockedHansel and Gretel into a cage
  while she prepared to eat them. Iremembered saying to my mother that they
  hadn’t done anythingwrong, so surely the witch could not harm them, and my
  mother tellingme that I was right. If you are innocent and you put your faith
  andtrust into whatever you do, you cannot be harmed by anyone.
</p>
<p>
  Having just escaped from my wretched life as a petty tyrant I wasabout as
  innocent as a naughty child caught with his hand in the cookiejar: going
  through the door would have meant certain death. I
</p>
<p>
  pondered the consequences and I wondered whether if I failed I woulddie
  physically, perhaps suffering a heart attack. I didn’t have a clue asto the
  outcome. Silence answered.
</p>
<p>
  Then in a stroke I realised that I was already dead. Or moreaccurately, there
  was no death. There was no fear, I simply walkedthrough the door, fearing
  nothing. No heroism was involved, nocourage, just realisation.
</p>
<p>
  I passed through the door unharmed and entered a beautifulgarden. In the
  centre I found a huge Magnolia tree. As I looked up, alarge blossom tumbled
  down and landed softly in my cupped hands. Ilooked at the petals
  affectionately as they surrendered in my palms. Ihad passed the test,
</p>
<p>
  I looked up at the Magnolia tree and there at the top hung themost glorious
  blooms I had ever seen. I made an effort to rise from theground into the air
  to pick the flower. It was hard work and tookseveral attempts and a number of
  elaborate stunts and complicatedacrobatics to claw my way to the top. When I
  got there I saw that thesame blossom I endeavored to pick was already nestling
  in my hand. ¢

<p>The great dimensional subdivisions</p>
<p>
  After many years of leaving my body and investigating alternate realities
  Ifeel tempted to draw a summary and paint a reasonably comprehensiveimage of
  what life will be like when we disassociate ourselves finally fromthe dense
  vibrations that form our physical dimension. In some ways thismay differ from
  the accounts given by mediums and psychics, firstly becausethese are firsthand
  accounts and secondly because they are not addressed tothose bereaved.
  Consequently, I see myself more as a reporter than as acouncillor, a
  researcher rather than a transmitter of other people’s views orspirit
  observations. The fact that I have been there myself to see it and hear itmay
  fill in any gaps in knowledge mediums may have brought across withthem.
</p>
<p>
  T am confident in fact that science has come to the conclusion thatphysical
  life in the universe simply can’t exist without other dimensionsunderpinning
  its existence. Unfortunately, I am not a scientist; if I was, myviewpoint
  would have been conditioned rather differently than by my workas an artist.
  The conclusions I draw are, obviously, subjective, and futureobservers may
  differ in their own.
</p>
<p>
  Surprisingly, it has taken science quite a long time to realise that we
  arepart of a multiple-universe. It is the same paradigm shift for our
  perceptionas the discoveries of fire, the wheel and that the Earth is a sphere
  and
</p>
<p>
  2volves around the sun. Incredibly, psychology and the science of the mindtill
  need to catch up and move beyond looking at consciousness as afunction of
  biological and chemical events within the brain.
</p>
<p>
  What we will have to acknowledge is the fact that the universe ‘outside’not
  only has its origin in other dimensions, but that we as living organismsare at
  every moment operating in other dimensions without realising it, here
</p>
<p>
  and now, In fact, to imagine that we could function as purely
  physicaldimensional entities strikes me as absurd, because it would be akin
  toimagining that the Earth could exist without the space it is suspended in.
</p>
<p>
  Incredibly, we still believe that the brain is the main storage organ
  foreverything we experience. Considering the fact that every moment -
  everysplit second - we encounter trillions of bits of information via our
  visionalone, it is clear that scientists still have no idea as to where or how
  the datais stored. All we know is that the brain’s synapses process the data.
  Bystudying the brain from a biological viewpoint we may understand itsfunction
  but not its deeper mystery.
</p>
<p>
  When looking at it from the next dimension up the brain is a
  fantastictelay_station - a processing and communication plant between
  twodimensions. The information appears to be stored_on another
  dimensionaltogether in a state that simply cannot be attributed to molecules
  or physicalatoms. This doesn’t apply only to the information gathered in our
  presenttime-space continuum, but also to information gathered while living
  indifferent energy configurations such as previous lives and inter-lives.
</p>
<p>
  First we will have to accept that life in the next dimension will bedifferent
  for everyone, the same as it is here, so to give a comprehensivedescription of
  life ‘over there’ is impossible. Every afterlife will be different.
</p>
<p>
  The best way of describing it is by drawing a parallel of three visitorsfrom
  outer space landing on Earth and having to report back of what theyfind. One
  lands in the desert, the other one in the middle of Venice and thethird
  underwater in the Great Barrier Reef. Obviously, each one of themwould give an
  accurate yet totally different account. Even if they had alllanded in the same
  place their accounts would still deviate because theywould focus on different
  attributes in accordance with their viewpoints andpersonalities,
</p>
<p>
  What can be said is that people vibrating on a higher energy level willbe
  living more enjoyable and satisfying lives than those on a lower one.
</p>
<p>
  By higher I mean energies which are not centered around selfishinstincts to
  the exclusion of others. Psychologists of the future will workmore effectively
  once they acknowledge that there are hierarchies of energies,which will lead
  to more fulfilling lives, a fact first pointed out in-depth by theAmerican
  psychologist Abraham Maslow and investigated and appliedpresently by cognitive
  therapists.
</p>
<p>
  In the next dimension we simply find that people leading selfish livesgather
  in a corresponding environment which greatly limits their power,whereas people
  who lead altruistic lives, enjoy the pleasurable emotions oflove and caring
  and have positive expansive creative energies, will havegreater power and a
  more agreeable environment on the next dimension. It issimply nature's law of
  like attracting like.
</p>
<p>
  In reality, death in itself does not have to be the dramatic downturn ofevents
  in one’s life as it is painted from our mortal point of view. Except for avery
  few occasions I have never experienced the same sense of drama asreported by
  people with near-death experiences; however this may be due tothe fact that I
  have learned to treat these events as a fairly natural process,which leads me
  to believe dying too can be a quite undramatic and naturalProcess,
</p>
<p>
  ‘We should not suffer the illusion that life will take a dramatic turnwhen
  shifting into another dimension. I can't imagine that there is a
  greatdifference between leaving one’s body temporarily or permanently, except
  ofcourse if it is brought about by trauma.
</p>
<p>
  For the average dying person it will be no more dramatic than going tosleep,
  because very little will actually have changed when arriving on theother side.
  Many people will take some convincing that they are dead as thefirst
  impression is that they feel just as alive as before. Even the environmentwill
  be the same. Gradually, though, nature’s laws of attraction will kick inand
  connect us to our natural energy environment. This can mean that
  ourenvironment changes into the proverbial Heaven or Hell. Or we can
  continuesimply and gradually from where we left off via the gradual process
  oflearning and advancement.
</p>
<p>
  ‘ Many of us who suffer depression may find ourselves in a bleak
  world.Fortunately, if our basic character is sound, and we generally operate
  on aaltruistic energy level, we will find that we are much closer to turning
  ourstate of mind around than we would be able to on the gross physical
  Earth.For a start we would attract helpers and energies that would assist us
  themoment we opened our minds and hearts. This doesn’t happenautomatically,
  though: the mind must open first.
</p>
<p>
  There is little point in describing the afterlife. The afterlife of a rock
  starwill be totally different from that of a nun or a racing driver, the same
  as theirlives are here. All I can do is focus on the underlying reality and
  allow the
</p>
<p>
  reader to imagine what their own afterlife will be like once they take all
  theirdreams, loves and likes into consideration.
</p>
<p>The broad subdivisions</p>
<p>
  As we have established, it is not possible to give a comprehensive
  descriptionof the higher dimension. What I've written is nothing more than
  traveljournals like those written by any orthodox travel writer. The best that
  can bedone is to describe certain universal laws which underpin the
  dimensionsand allow the readers to use their imagination to paint their own
  picture.
</p>
<p>
  There is a consensus among mystics and occultist alike (who refer tothese
  dimensions as the Astral or Mental Planes) that the purpose of theseworlds is
  to express and fulfill desires and, as on earth, to provide a training-ground
  for self-development, and this is exactly what they do.
</p>
<p>
  Let us start with self-development, There can’t be a better training-ground
  for evolution then the lowest and most hellish of dimensions whereividual is
  faced with the shortcomings of his or her personality andnces the dire
  consequences of their actions. If this type of learningsystem could be
  implemented on Earth, replacing traditional forms ofincarceration and
  punishment, crime rates would drop dramatically, becausethe instant a crime
  was committed the perpetrator would experience thecrime from his victim’s
  viewpoint and suffer the same consequences. Theseare simply the ways in which
  nature works. Justice and punishment are notadministered by a superior
  intelligence, they are simply the result of subtleenergy balances.
</p>
<p>
  Even on the higher subdivision, learning, self expression and evolutionare the
  primal aspects of higher dimensional life. There are plenty ofopportunities
  for further education once the novelty of pursuing one’sdreams has worn off.
</p>
<p>
  But living and realising one’s dreams is, of course, one of the mostimportant,
  and, to many, the most attractive function of the otherdimensions. The desire
  for all the things we strive for in this life builds uppowerful energies and
  the way nature has designed its release is by allowingus to express them to
  the full on the next dimension. To many of us livinghere on Earth, this would
  be a ‘lottery win’, Though this can mean differentthings to different people.
  I have seen people driving supercars, living inmagnificent houses and having
  all the trappings a millionaire lifestyle has to
</p>
<p>asa</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man</p>
<p>
  offer, although the expression of these desires is very much dependent on
  thelevel the individual has advanced to, There is simply not enough
  creativeenergy on the lower levels to allow these dreams to come to fruition
  and aperson will have to ‘earn’ the power of realisation by a process of moral
  andpsychological purification. On top of that, the absence of aging, illness
  anddecay, and all the things that are needed to maintain the functioning of
  thephysical body, are tremendous added bonuses, as is the power to
  travelinstantly to any place you wish.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The more a person purifies their psychological make-up, harmonisingtheir
  nature, the more their life will become symmetrical and will allow for
  agreater flow of energy, which will in turn open their creative channels,
  andthereafter the power of creation increases proportionally’.
</p>
<p>
  ‘These powers become ever more magnified on the higher dimensionallevels,
  together with an increased level of awareness and an expandedconsciousness. In
  fact the person synchronizes with the universal energy andaccesses the very
  matrix of creation. To give an example, I struggled when I‘was conjuring up
  wine in a supermarket? on the lower plane, and when I didthe wine tasted poor,
  more like juice.
</p>
<p>
  On a much higher plane, people are able to control the environment,evoke
  natural phenomena and create incredible cities and miracles of art andscience.
  The moment a person rises higher, the vibrational gap between thatdimension
  and Earth becomes larger and communication, particularly via aclairvoyant,
  more difficult. From the deceased person's point-of-view, theirmotivation for
  contacting those left behind on Earth decreases steadily fortwo reasons: the
  first one is that Earth life, in the face of expandingconsciousness, is viewed
  more like a distant dream than reality, and thesecond is that the individual
  is operating on a higher dimension andconsequently has more power at his or
  her disposal to affect the welfare oftheir loved ones left behind on Earth.
  They are more in tune with the soul or
</p>
<p>
  core energy of the person on Earth and can exert greater powers more wiselyto
  help them on a much higher and more intelligent level.

<p>The lower dimensions: worlds of suffering</p>
<p>The lowest dimensions</p>
<p>
  There are fundamental differences between appearances on the physicaldimension
  and the nonphysical. For a start, on the physical dimension a“beautiful”
  person, meaning a person of high ethical qualities and soundcharacter, can
  inhabit a body of any shape or size from extremely beautiful tovery
  unattractive. They can be suffering from debilitating illnesses,
  bedisadvantaged in terms of growth, looks or appearance and yet
  theirPersonality can shine and be an inspiration to other people. Conversely
  anindividual's physical appearance may be that of a super model and yet
  theircharacter and personality may leave a lot to be desired. This is not the
  caseon the nonphysical dimensions. Here a person of sound
  character_willassemble around themselves a matching body. The more highly
  developedtheir ethical qualities the more attractive their bodies. To anyone
  who hasbeen disadvantaged in their physical life, the next one may reveal
  their truestunning attractiveness in keeping with their inner personality. The
  sameholds true with their environment and dwellings. A billionaire on earth
  mayfind his circumstances reversed, depending on his or her inner qualities
  and@ person having lived life in poor conditions may wake up in splendour.
</p>
<p>
  The reason for this becomes clear instantly when looking at the natureof the
  universal energies of creation. The higher the dimension, the moreexpanded the
  consciousness which becomes increasingly harmonised andaware of its unifying
  origin. As a consequence the flow of creative energy isgreatly enhanced the
  more a person is aligned with the cosmic laws of unityand harmony. So
  consciousness becomes more powerful and with thecreative energies flowing more
  freely through them they create a more
</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>
  oosymmetrical and harmonious appearance. One only has to look at thephysical
  world to see that if a plant is not nourished properly it will wither.
</p>
<p>
  In the absence of any redeeming qualities the inhabitants’ appearancecan be
  dramatically affected, producing a Gollum-like!? character, someonewhose
  appearance is stunted, deformed, ugly and hideous, even down totorn and shabby
  ragged clothes. Their dwelling places may be no better thanhuts, or simply
  holes in the ground. They don’t have the power of flight,because flying on the
  next dimension requires discipline or elevated levels ofemotions. They
  scuttle, bent over as if carrying a tremendous burden. Alll ofwhich is simply
  the expression of the contents of their minds and an absenceof humane
  qualities.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, people functioning on such low mentality as to warrantexistence
  on the very lowest level are in the minority. The majority of decenthuman
  citizens may never get close to that.
</p>
<p>A matter of harmony and discord</p>
<p>
  Thave had a number of experiences in a dimension or alm that was moredrab and
  appeared to be in a sense more ‘physical’ than anything I hadexperienced so
  far on Earth. These places were twilight zones: inhospitable,like damp foggy
  November days. The closest description of the atmosphereis of sadness and
  depression, although I personally was never sad ordepressed while visiting
  them. Leaving my body behind always gave me apowerful positive thrill, but I
  could not figure out what it was that attractedme to these drab places. It
  could have been that it was a dimension situatedclose to our physical world
  and therefore difficult to avoid. Many years laterI saw a film called The
  Others and I was fascinated by how closely the filmresembled my experiences:
  the heaviness, the darkness and the mist wereuncanny.
</p>
<p>
  It is rather saddening to realise that these drab worlds are actuallyinhabited
  by people. They are not necessarily bad people, but people whosomehow got
  lost, perhaps as a result of their state of mind. I realised that it‘was by no
  means a forgone conclusion that I would be granted residence inone of the more
  pleasant places of beauty and splendor, to be welcomed byfriends and relatives
  who had passed on before me, simply because I have
</p>
<p>
  10Creature from ‘Lord ofthe Rings, whose appearance changed as he became
  compte by the evil ofering
</p>
<p>
  led a fairly “good” life. To my astonishment and distress I discovered that
  my.mother, who was a very warmhearted, much-liked person, spent many years
</p>
<p>
  —atter her death in a rather drab place. Her only crime was that she
  hadsuffered long years of depression and the last few years of her life were
  spentin a very unhappy relationship. Her state of mind confined her to
  continuingunhappiness. On the times I managed to visit her after she died I
  wasperplexed to see how little she had managed to deal with her unhappinessand
  I was dismayed by the fact that there seemed to be little justice andcomfort
  for her in her surroundings. I could do little more than hug andreassure her
  whenever we met. It was as if she was shrouded in a thickblanket of mist, and
  although I saw that my grandmother was with her onfone occasion, nobody
  managed to banish the veil surrounding her. Finally,and to my great relief,
  she appeared as her old youthful self, dressed ina *splendid gown, welcoming
  me. It was about six years after her physicaldeath, and 1 will report on the
  meeting in a later chapter.
</p>
<p>
  I have had plenty of practice helping other people when out-of-bodyand I know
  for sure that there are many discarnate ‘social workers’ havingtheir work cut
  out for them giving a helping hand to people who simplyhaven't managed to deal
  with their mental turmoil. No matter whether youhave been a morally good
  person — just as in real life - the afterlife won'tchange anything unless you
  work through your problems.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, the same laws apply as on the physical plane: conflict,turmoil and
  suffering are an opportunity for growth. Now ]
</p>
<p>
  This is an example of how a mental state can confine you to a very darkand
  hellish place through no fault of your own, other than being incapable
  ofdealing with your distress. It is the example of my uncle, who was
  badlywounded during the Second World War and was left severely disabled.
  1can’t remember a time when he wasn’t in pain. His attitude towards life
  overthe years became bitter, his only form of humor was one of sarcasm
  and¢ynicism. He focused continuously on the negatives in life, finding fault
  witheverything. As a result, his wife (my aunt) who I always remembered as
  avery kind and generous person, became very negative and pessimistic also.
</p>
<p>
  I met my uncle three years after his death, It was a dull and sad —place,
  worse than the dingy and damp flat they were assigned to asrefugees just after
  the War. He showed me his stiff leg which hadn’thealed. He told me that life
  was unjust and that there was no reward
</p>
<p>
  for sacrifice and that he had been kicked in the teeth for giving his lifefor
  his country. I tried to persuade him that a change of attitude mayaffect an
  external change and encouraged him to find it in himself tolook at some good
  things, like his two beautiful daughters, one whomhad a very happy marriage to
  a successful businessman, the other whohad helped many people as a social
  worker. I told him that in thisworld his injury was in his mind and that he
  didn’t have to stay in thisdrab place, but could move on to a sunnier place,
  which he deserved.
</p>
<p>But he would have none of it.</p>
<p>“This is what everybody keeps telling me,” he said. “But I tell</p>
<p>
  ? you what, the only person I can rely on is the Devil.”*: With that he made
  the sign of Devil's horns and scuttled off stifflyinto the mist.
</p>
<p>
  Life can be cruel, but just because we die it doesn’t mean we are assureda
  place on a heavenly dimension. Work will continue. The suicide will find
  totheir distress that nothing has changed and that their present afterlife
</p>
<p>
  — conditions are made worse by the heartache they have caused to those
  leftbehind, Simply being a ‘good’ person and leading a ‘good’ life
  doesn’tPromote us to a place in heaven automatically. And there is no reason
  whyreality should differ from our physical reality just because it’s on a
  differentdimension. In the end it comes down to truth and the laws of nature.
  There isno mollycoddling in the next world. If anything, we are much more
  exposedto the truth and there are fewer hiding places from it than on the
  physicalEarth, where we are offered freedom to pretend, deceive and escape.
</p>
<p>
  Poverty is a state of mind. Some of the regions I visited were the
  closestthing to hell I can imagine. People suffering from mental illness
  anddepression were found in a bleak and lonely environment, but at least
  theyhad many sympathetic people standing by who were only too eager to
  helpthem to get out of their state of affairs and to escort them to a much
  brighterregion.
</p>
<p>
  This cannot be said of people who were out to take advantage of theirfellow
  human being, to the extent of causing misery and destruction:
</p>
<p>
  || fraudsters, rapists, murderers, psychopaths and a whole range of
  characters¥ who had chosen to cause suffering to other people.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing, of course, is ever black and white, but generally speakingthese
  people tend to meet their match in the next life simply because of the
</p>
<p>
  laws of attraction, These realms, created by minds incapable of altruism,
  areProbably the inspiration to many a horror movie, There are regions
  wherethere isn’t even evil, just poverty of mind.
</p>
<p>I can remember one such place.</p>
<p>Desolate places19th September 1977</p>
<p>
  My awakening into lucidity happened gradually until finally I poppedinto full
  waking consciousness. When I looked around I was in adeserted square in a
  large city. By its vibrations I identified it as thelower dimensional
  counterpart of the city of Hamburg, But this was aneglected place, unlike its
  prosperous physical counterpart. Wind blewTubbish through the street. I walked
  towards a wall and studied thedetail of a half torn-off poster. I could feel
  the rough texture of thetipped edges and even see the raster dots of the
  print.
</p>
<p>
  I was amazed by the amount of random and intricate detail andwondered how it
  had come into existence. I decided that it was such anpeczuste copy that I was
  on a lower level right next to the physicalplane. With fascination I observed
  the rubbish being blown through thestreet by a cold wind and for a moment I
  considered whether thistubbish was nothing more then the negative content of
  people’s mindsstill walking the Earth. I also pondered whether people who
  arrived inthis place after their death would realise that they were dead,
  because itwas such an authentic replica of physical life with nothing
  supernaturalor unnatural about it.But this certainly was not the physical
  Earth. It looked nothinglike the Hamburg I knew, it just had the feeling of
  that city. As Iwandered the deserted streets I thought about death and how
  difficultit must be for dead people in the face of such blatant reality to
  acceptthe fact that they had died, and how they may have wondered whathad
  happened to them - what mysterious forces had transported themto this bleak
  and forsaken place. I saw a few lost souls wandering aboutaimlessly, puzzling
  over how they got here or how to get home.It was extremely dull. Dusky grey
  and with a stark and ominouspresence or atmosphere, somehow ‘too real’ to be
  Earth. But although
</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>
  fythis was unpleasant it was by no means the worst place I had comeacross.
</p>
<p>
  Although I had a vague curiosity to find out what attractedpeople to this
  place - how they got here and why - I was demotivatedto follow my curiosity
  when I looked at the dreary figures mopingaround, who were not even aware that
  I existed.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to rise into the air to explore further. I glided ten feetabove the
  ground, but when I came across a building site I camecrashing down. I felt a
  sharp pain in my head and right arm, which Iobserved with curiosity. Until now
  I had assumed that pain was auniquely physical experience. This was the first
  time I had felt physicalpain while out of my body. And it was ‘super real’,
  ‘super pain’. I wasshocked to realise that far from being released from
  physical pain afterdeath, people who found themselves here were exposed to the
  prospectof experiencing pain far greater than on Earth. I thought that the
  levelof pain and suffering could be exponentially greater in regions
  denser,lower and more negative than this. My own pain was a bluntillustration
  of this, and it was only when I reminded myself that I hadthe power to control
  my thoughts and feelings that the pain subsided.
</p>
<p>
  I knew then that for some people death may not be an escapefrom their
  physicals discomforts at all, but an intensification of it,depending on their
  state of mind. It dawned on me with horror that onlevels much lower than this
  there could be hells of unimaginable
</p>
<p>suffering.</p>
<p>The old man in the hut</p>
<p>
  Date not rememberedI don’t remember how I got to the place, but it was cold
  and dark. I wasdisappointed that on this relatively rare occasion of
  journeying intoanother dimension I had found myself yet again in a dismal,
  wretchedplace. Was I being punished by some higher power for some crime Ihad
  committed in the past? Whatever it might have been that broughtme to this
  place, it wasn’t as a result of how I felt.
</p>
<p>‘Trusting in the possibility that there was something to be gained</p>
<p>
  from this, I wandered through the desert. I was not alone - I felt apresence
  close by. It was reassuring, benevolent, but I could not see
</p>
<p>
  anyone. Whatever it was it did not protect me from a very unpleasantchill
  making me shiver. Again I was reminded that pain was not a forcebelonging
  solely to Earth: in fact, this cold was more fierce than any Icould remember.
  It was not just extremely bitter, but positively cruel. Ithad an emotional
  aspect that physical cold does not have, which madeit much less bearable than
  its Earth equivalent. This was pain literallyof another dimension. With it
  came an absolute absence of hope orredemption — from what I did not know.
</p>
<p>
  Then, suddenly, the cold became more acceptable, almost as ifsomebody had
  thrown a warm blanket around me. I was here to learn,to observe, not to
  suffer. I knew I didn’t belong here. Others were not solucky. This was home
  for those shadows darting through the desert - ahome in tune with their
  natures. Having strayed into this God-forsakenregion, which seemed to be
  stretching into infinity, I wondered wherethese exiled souls could turn to to
  find their way out. There were nolights for as far as the eye could see: no
  beacons of hope, only vast,dark, cold desert. My advantage was that I knew I
  could return tophysical consciousness simply by waking up. The souls condemned
  tolive here had no such option.
</p>
<p>
  I noticed a shack in the distance. Compared to the dirty holes Ihad seen, this
  seemed like luxury. When I strayed inside the shack,which was thrown together
  from rough pieces of wood and junk, withlarge gaps in between, I saw a very
  old, thin man squatting in front of astove which had no fire. He seemed
  oblivious of my presence. HisPoverty of mind and appearance was reflected in
  the junk he hadaccumulated around himself - collected pieces of rubbish he may
  havepicked up in the desert in a sad attempt to create some semblance ofhome
  comfort. I felt repelled, sensing he was a cruel and selfish man.
</p>
<p>
  The coldness of this realm was a natural extension of his owncharacter and the
  pain he felt. He was a bitter_man, maybedisappointed by his fellows. Here he
  could be by himself. I could nottell whether he knew that he was dead or
  simply that he blamed anunjust fate for his condition.
</p>
<p>
  I felt a vague obligation to help, but a stronger urge to get awayfrom him.
  Then a sudden sadness found itself in me - a great sense ofpity for such
  abandonment. He too had once been a child, then he hadfailed life’s
  challenges. He had made some wrong choices. I stared at
</p>
<p>
  him, but I didn’t have the energy to intervene and was relieved when Ifound
  myself awake in my bed.
</p>
<p>On many occasions I was aware of a kind of companion. Somebody</p>
<p>
  who seemed to have taken me under his wing, a silent presence that escortedme
  to certain places, like this one, just to observe. No words were exchanged,but
  I knew the purpose of my visit each time. But on other occasions I wasenlisted
  to help such as in the following event.
</p>
<p>
  Almost as soon as I left my body I was escorted by a silent~— uardian to a
  place which was dark and impregnated with fear. But I‘was reassured by a
  benevolent, empowering energy.
</p>
<p>
  Twas led into a sparse room where a man had been tied to achair and was being
  tortured. He was a victim of a brutal regime. Thehenchmen serving the
  punishment received a cruel satisfaction fromtheir evil deed, but their victim
  was my focus. To my relief my guideindicated that his ordeal was nearly over
  and that I was there to easehis distress and Prepare him to move as gently as
  possible into the nextdimension, He said there was a real danger that his
  state of mind couldbe so severely unbalanced by the ordeal that it could
  catapult him intoa very dark place, which he didn’t deserve.
</p>
<p>
  Every time pain was applied to his body I knew that he could seeus. My
  invisible partner had generated a soothing light around theman: when he passed
  out from the pain, the light was there to comforthim.
</p>
<p>tried to hold his attention and said with all the positive warmth</p>
<p>
  — Tcould muster, “It will soon be over - just be patient.” I felt great
  pityfor him and compensated for his pain with warmth and love,reassuring him
  with thoughts of the beautiful world I told him hewould enter. I knew I was
  getting through to him, and my guideconfirmed it by increasing the radiance
  around him. f
</p>
<p>
  The man’s face relaxed and he smiled. Then he returned to hisbody for the last
  time. He didn’t even feel the pain of the blow whichkilled him. My guide took
  over and carried him away. I returned to mybody.
</p>
<p>
  Tt is tough to come to terms with the cruelty and inhumanity of somepeople who
  are in stark contrast to the millions of helpers who compensateand ease the
  burden of these monstrous crimes. One thing is certain: evil isincompatible
  with a life on the higher dimensions, which are saturated withlove, goodwill
  and creativity. It is as inevitable that such cruelty will seek acorresponding
  environment after death, as it is inevitable that the countlesshelpers whose
  lives are driven by compassion and a consuming instinct tohelp, are rooted in
  a dimension which is permeated with light, symmetry andbeauty.
</p>
<p>
  And yet these opposing forces can live side by side within anindividual. Their
  inner battle will decide which part will gain the upperhand.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, I saw a video recording of a suicide bomber who talked inloving
  terms to his young daughter sitting on his lap about the mission forwhich he
  had to sacrifice himself and many innocent people. I felt that hisBreat crime
  was one of supreme arrogance and self delusion, which hadcondemned so many
  innocent lives to premature death, but had alsobetrayed his young daughter.
  Looking at the picture on the TY, I could seethe vast, hellish landscape of
  his afterlife unravel before me. His realisationthat all he had accomplished
  was to create suffering, the abandonment of hischild, her hatred and perhaps,
  when she grew up, her pity, as well as thelifelong anguish of the relatives of
  his victims, will take more than oneafterlife to make amends.
</p>
<p>
  The simple truth of this universe is that there are two major forces atwork:
  one of empowerment, unity, love and creativity, attracting energiesfrom the
  highest dimensions and one of destruction, segregation, hatred and

<p>7th January 2005</p>
<p>
  I have already touched on my mother’s fate after her death. I lived inEngland
  while she was still alive and only ever saw her once a year. After shesuffered
  a stoke, she used a wheelchair and was looked after by her elderlysecond
  husband, When he died the house was sold and it was then that Ifound out from
  an old neighbour the cruel extent of her unhappiness andsuffering. She never
  once complained to me or either of my brothers because
</p>
<p>
  she was always one to put on a brave face. It was only when her
  depressionbecame obvious that we sought help for her. But she suffered another
  strokeand died shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>
  After her death I met her a number of times when out of my body. I
  wasdistressed to see that she was cut off from everyone, surrounded by a
  darkcloud I simply could not penetrate. I saw my grandmother next to her
  tellingme that she was keeping an eye on her, but that she could not reach
  her. Thethought of her unhappiness was never far from my mind.
</p>
<p>
  I started meditation at 7 am. I varied my techniques occasionally.In my mind I
  conjured up one of my favorite scenes, where I boarded aoat and was taken to a
  small island with a temple. Then I visualisedmyself sitting in the temple on a
  chair showered with light, meditating.I decided to contemplate the nature of
  higher consciousness. To do so, Iabandoned my visualisation in favour of
  entering a ‘being state’, acondition the Indian philosopher Krishnamurti
  called “choicelessawareness” - the true state of being; an awareness of the
  here-and-now,
</p>
<p>
  — without any attributes. It is an effective way of leaving behind
  anyattachments to the ego or the personal life.
</p>
<p>
  After an hour-and-a-half, seductive dream images started driftingpast me and
  it was challenging not to be tempted into following them.In order to avoid
  this, I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. It was8:45 am. I re-entered my
  meditation and returned my attention slowly
</p>
<p>‘to an acute and highly focused waking awareness.</p>
<p>
  After a short while my wife, Julia, entered the room and told methat it was
  nearly 9 o’clock, and she wondered whether I could take theChristmas tree out
  so that the rubbish collectors could take it away. Itold her that I needed to
  meditate just a few minutes longer to easemyself out of the deep state I was
  in, At the same time I thought tomyself that it was a very odd request, since
  I had chucked out the
</p>
<p>
  — Christmas tree days earlier. There was an inconsistency to reality. Idecided
  that the best way to deal with it was to deepen my meditationwhile retaining
  full waking awareness.
</p>
<p>
  Strangely enough, when I opened my eyes again in order to endmy meditation I
  found myself in another room altogether. When Ilooked around I found my
  younger daughter sleeping on the floor, andnext to her, sitting up awake, her
  older sister. They looked much
</p>
<p>Dak</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man</p>
<p>
  younger than I knew them to be - just children, in fact. Although I wasalready
  awake, this inconsistency catapulted me into full wakingconsciousness. Then,
  looking at them more closely, I discovered thatthey were not my children at
  all. At that moment a young lady enteredthe room. She was about thirty, with a
  gentle manner, very attractivewith long blonde hair. I apologised profusely to
  her for having enteredthe wrong room. She reassured me with a nice smile that
  there wasnothing to apologise for and I left the room.
</p>
<p>
  Outside in the hall I noticed that the house was huge, with a largeopen
  staircase. Lots of cheerful children were running about, playingfreely and
  chasing each other. There were toys everywhere, Somefriendly adults were
  reading to the children, others were playing withthem.
</p>
<p>
  As I walked down the staircase my head felt very heavy. It wasthe thick,
  trance-like drowsiness I sometimes experienced duringmeditation and I was keen
  to clear my head. Momentarily, I became‘unsure whether this might be real
  waking life and I tried to recall whatThad done before and how I might have
  arrived at this place. The onlyway to prove to myself that this was not the
  physical level was to liftoff the ground into the air, in what I referred to
  as the “flying test”. Sureenough I left the ground effortlessly and hovered
  several feet above theBround. This realisation gave me instant control over my
  mind and theheaviness in my head just rolled away like fog over a field.
</p>
<p>
  The clarity was immense. All my senses awakened instantly. I leftthe nursery
  by walking down the large flight of stairs, out of the frontdoor and into the
  square of a large town. Walking down the road Idiscovered, to my surprise,
  discarded industrial junk. I identified is as‘thought junk’: abandoned,
  pointless thoughts, littering theenvironment. I was irritated to be confronted
  with such pollution. Thisput a dampener on my newfound freedom. I walked
  straight throughwide open doors into an ugly industrial building,
  Instinctively, I knewthat the environment was related closely to the way I
  felt.
</p>
<p>
  The only way I could improve my environment was by returning,to my meditation.
  Past experience told me that chanting the mantrawas the most potent way to
  affect change in this dimension. So I startedchanting.
</p>
<p>
  The first chant swept me instantly off my feet and sucked me upinto the air
  with a powerful force. The second chant came boomingfrom the centre of my
  chest and gave me an ecstatic thrill. The thirdchant was picked up by an
  invisible choir of disembodied angelicvoices of implausible sweetness that
  made me soar right to the ceilingof the building, which opened out and I
  sailed straight through into abrilliant blue sky. But it was not sky. It was
  an infinite, cathedral-likedome in a million blue hues.
</p>
<p>
  For a moment I considered chanting again to see where it wouldtake me, when I
  remembered suddenly the reason for my being here:the welfare of my mother.
  Years had passed since her death, and, on therare occasions when I saw her,
  she was a prisoner, cocooned in a cloudof sadness,
</p>
<p>
  I called out her name, loudly, heartfelt with joy. Instantly, andwith
  astonishing force, I was pulled through the air over a
  paradisiacalcountryside.
</p>
<p>
  I slowed down over an artistically landscaped park withornamental water
  features. I chose a modest and simple yet beautifulstone bench as my landing
  space. And, as I glided down, there she was,ina long green gown with gold
  embroidery.
</p>
<p>
  She was young, in her thirties - angelic looking, with a warm,almost
  voluptuous figure. Her gentle smile cracked finally into a burstof joy. I felt
  a wave of incredible love surging towards me as I landedright next to her and
  told her in German: “Just give mea good hug.”
</p>
<p>
  The joy of seeing her so happy for the first time after so manyyears moved me
  to tears. She too had tears of joy in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
  I told her that the most incredible thing of our meeting was thatthis was not
  a dream and that I was in a complete and super awakestate of consciousness.
  She nodded and smiled. I told her that I hadbeen very concerned for her
  welfare all these years and that it was justthe happiest moment to see her in
  such splendid surroundings. Shetold me she knew how I had felt.
</p>
<p>
  We had another long hug, mother and son. I felt like a childagain, totally
  surrendering to her love.
</p>
<p>
  Lasked her whether she still felt lonely. Referring to the last fewyears of
  her life on Earth she said simply: “The people you are with onEarth are not
  always the people you want to be with over here.”
</p>
<p>
  Her neighbour had told my brothers and I that my mother’shusband had totally
  controlled her life and would not allow any of herfriends to see her. The
  neighbour, being an old woman, did not knowhow to contact us to let us know
  what went on. She told us that mymother never received the help she needed.
  The few times she wentround to see my mother, her husband yelled at her and
  sent her away.He was extremely jealous and possessive and guarded her until
  shewas totally isolated.
</p>
<p>
  It was too late when my brother intervened and she died a fewweeks later from
  a stroke.
</p>
<p>
  My mother told me that everything we experience makes somesense and that we
  should not feel bad about it. We talked a little moreuntil I felt reassured.
  This is how she really was, despite the hardship ofher life. Suddenly I became
  aware of my own physical discomfort as ofsitting in meditation.
</p>
<p>
  After correcting my position, I entering the same state again, butmy mother
  had gone. I did not manage to enter the heavenly realmwhere my mother seemed
  to lead her new life. Instead, I walkedthrough a town, deep in thought,
  wondering how I could meet heragain. Perhaps I could connect with my father,
  whom I had loved andwho had died when I was nine years old as well.
</p>
<p>
  In the corner of my eye I saw a man following me. Then he camedancing
  alongside me, trying to get my attention. “It is imperative thatyou listen to
  me,” he said. “This is extremely important.”
</p>
<p>
  He told me that he knew how to prevent catching AIDS. “I dotoo,” I said
  impatiently, wishing to return to thoughts of my motherand father. “You just
  encourage people to use condoms.”
</p>
<p>
  “No, no,” he insisted. “We have found how to cure it and avoidthe spread of
  AIDS. You need to listen to me and carry the informationacross.”
</p>
<p>
  He then proceeded to spread out the whole bulk of informationright in front of
  me as we walked along. Before long he had engulfedme in a giant thought form;
  everything seemed to make sense, but itwas all just too much for me to take
  in.
</p>
<p>
  “Unfortunately,” I told him, “I am the wrong person to pass thismessage on.” I
  told him that he should make an effort to locate a more
</p>
<p>
  scientific or medically inclined messenger, who was able to make moresense of
  all this.
</p>
<p>
  He explained to me his difficulty that most people just thought ofit as a
  dream and discarded it as such when they woke up, and that itwas relatively
  rare to bump into somebody who was so fully consciousand aware.
</p>
<p>
  1 apologised to him again and told him there was no way I couldput everything
  he was showing me into a sensical format, let alone findany professional who
  would take me seriously. He nodded dejectedly. Ifelt very sorry indeed, albeit
  with a sense of relief that I did not have tocarry the burden. But the regret
  was certainly strong.
</p>
<p>
  On reflection, I felt I may have been too eager to dissociate myselffrom the
  knowledge, and I wondered whether with a bit more patienceand focus I would
  have been able to bring some of this vitalinformation across - and what it
  would have felt like.
</p>
<p>
  It would be an uplifting thought to imagine that all people whocondemned
  themselves so foolishly to the lower dimension would one daytise phoenix-like
  into a happier existence. We can take comfort in the fact thatthis indeed will
  be so, no matter how long it takes. I have learned that the
</p>
<p>j Whole genesis of this universe is programmed to evolve consciousness</p>
<p>
  FT through many dimensions. It is reassuring to find that no matter
  howmonstrous our crimes, how deep our delusions and ignorance, we are onlyan
  atom away from the universal truth that there is really only one source forall
  life.
</p>
<p>
  Describing the lower dimensions where people suffer is as impossibleas
  describing the nature of grief: simply, it is different for every person.
  Thereare as many hells within this hell, as there are people. Even an
  earthquake isexperienced differently by every victim. Nevertheless, hells are
  broughtabout by states of mind. It’s a matter of corresponding energies. It’s
  as simpleas that.
</p>
<p>The earth-like dimensions</p>
<p>
  More knowledge seems to be filtering through from the first and
  seconddimensions. These also appear to be the most populated dimensions
  simplybecause they are the ones which match Earth’s vibrational frequency
  closest.A few people spend what amounts to a lifetime here, patiently awaiting
  thedeath of those left behind, while others begin to realise very soon
  thelimitation of this plane and become restless and seek advancement. There
  areplenty of helpers from higher dimensions ready to assist. Others simply
  sailthrough this region without touching the ground, following the
  naturalattraction of their more purified make-up to a higher dimension.
</p>
<p>
  It is comparatively rare that many people, when venturing out of theirbodies,
  experience the higher realms, because their physical consciousnessdraws them
  naturally to the environment that resembles our planet. Most ofmy experiences
  have taken place here as well and I am pretty certain that mostcommunication
  from deceased relatives via mediums are sent from here. Wehear very few
  descriptions of these mind-boggling higher planes transmittedto clairvoyants,
  simply because people on the lower level are still very muchattached to the
  life they have left behind - their family’s welfare, etc.
</p>
<p>
  The next dimension is no more than a counterpart of Earth, a carboncopy of the
  place we have come to love and cherish, although there are someimportant
  differences. The thoughts of people living on Earth are still verymuch in
  evidence. It is not unusual to find derelict buildings or even buildingsites.
  It is by no means the bright, symmetrical, clean and summery realmoften
  referred to as the ‘Summer Land’ in occult literature.
</p>
<p>
  The atmosphere varies from region to region, just like on Earth and it iseasy
  to understand why it is such a hard task to convince people that they aredead.
  The changes dawn upon them only very gradually - often they are
</p>
<p>. omf \pore wed I vrtmrs to ors dead</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man</p>
<p>
  accepted as a matter of course. The fact that they appear younger, and
  otherchanges in the laws of nature, are often accepted in the same spirit in
  which‘one would accept relocation to another country on Earth. Life in death
  isexperienced in the same state of mind as life on Earth was.
</p>
<p>
  A number of people I met were astonished when I presented them withthe fact
  that they were living in the land of the dead, which made meconsider the
  possibility that at least some of them may have regarded theirpast Earth life
  as a kind of dream, Some most certainly hadn't cottoned on tothe fact that
  they had died and they found very few clues of change. I noticedtheir tendency
  to try to explain inconsistencies away as rational expectations,sometimes in
  the most irrational ways. It often takes the appearance of adeceased relative
  to convince them of their new condition. Unfortunately,there are also
  occasions where you will find a ‘lost soul’ - a person whorealises that their
  situation has changed but just cannot find their bearings.
</p>
<p>
  Like most out-of-body travelers, the majority of my own experienceshave taken
  place in this region. I have got to know the region very well, tothe point
  that I recognise certain landmarks and places. I have been
  attractedirresistibly to the same place on more than one occasion, without
  ever findingout why. I have even bumped into people who I have recognised as
  friendsor companions on the other side. But the novelty of finding myself here
  onthese lower vistas when out-of-body has long worm off and generally I try
  toget out via the quickest route.
</p>
<p>
  At first, to the newcomer little realising the potential of the
  newopportunities this dimension has to offer, the pleasures to be pursued
  hereare very Earth-like, It is pleasant enough for those of us who are content
  inkeeping on doing what we've been used to. Especially with the added bonusof
  not having to work for a living, suffering illness or the frailties of old
  age.Gradually, though, bit by bit, our creative potential stirs, at first
  simplybecause we do not have to work in order to exist and so have ‘time’ on
  ourhands. We make new friends, discover new opportunities and gradually
  theatmosphere around us begins to lighten. The moment we begin to
  feeldissatisfied with our way of life and open ourselves to new influences,
  weembark, unstoppably, on a new and grand adventure.
</p>
<p>The following is a typical example.</p>
<p>What is real?23rd March 2002</p>
<p>
  I got up at 5 am having spent an hour focusing mainly on mybreathing, starting
  with deep breathing and easing gradually intonatural breath. At the same time
  I focused on my presence, imagining
</p>
<p>
  { myseit to be hovering just over the top of my head. I felt a lightPressure
  which was associated to a gentle luminous glow. Gradually Isank into a deep
  inner silence. There were thoughts, but they appearedto be drifting past at a
  great distance and kept at bay by anauthoritative feeling of ‘being’ and
  ‘presence’ which was detached frommy social and biological self.
</p>
<p>
  The image of a pyramid came and went. The thought occurred tome that I should
  take the cue and enter the pyramid in order to conductmy meditation in there;
  but I dismissed the idea as a distraction andallowed the ‘being presence’ to
  fill my awareness.
</p>
<p>
  I kept my awareness focused on ‘being’ and observed myselfdrifting deeper and
  deeper into a trance-like state. Dream fragments ¢floated past and it would
  have been easy to hitch a lift and be carried |away, but I resisted.
</p>
<p>
  However, the image of riding on a train was irresistibly strongand real, I
  realised that by simply taking a greater interest in the train Icould have
  transported myself to it. But again I saw this as a distractionand refocused
  on pure awareness. Yet somehow the train would notleave my field of awareness
  and again I was tempted to investigate. Itwas a strange _mixture_of dream and
  awareness. Suddenly I wastraveling on it looking at the chipped paintwork of
  the carriage sixinches away from my face.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The reality of studying the minute scratches of the exposed metalunder the
  flaky paintwork catapulted me into super awareness. Inphysical life I wear
  glasses, but here I was intrigued by the astonishingsharpness and clarity of
  my vision. I took an extreme delight inenjoying such a novel visual
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  I remembered that during the days on Earth I had often ponderedthe nature of
  reality, matter and imagination in the next dimension. Iwondered where the
  mind assembled the astonishing amount of datarequired to create a detailed
  image, or whether perception was aconglomeration of objective matter and data
  contributed by the minditself.
</p>
<p>
  Now I had a chance to investigate objective matter in anotherdimension. I
  could tell that the train was non physical, by the strange
</p>
<p>
  terrain it travelled through and the slightly unorthodox design of
  thecarriages, and yet their physicalness was overpowering. I concludedthat the
  complexity of the material before my eyes was far too randomand complex to be
  imagined. Yet there was nothing about it that wasless real than physical
  reality. I wondered how the chipped paintworkhad come about in a universe
  where the aging process did not apply.
</p>
<p>
  Had I imagined or expected it, and had the matter of thisdimension complied
  with my expectation to assemble instantaneouslythe effect of decay right in
  front of my eyes!!? Or was I on anotherphysical dimension which definitely
  wasn’t Earth?
</p>
<p>
  Inoticed to my alarm that there were other typical signs of dreamcontent, like
  stuffing coming through the metal skin of the carriage.Then, with a powerful
  realisation, I knew that it was not a dream, butthat I was more awake than I
  could possibly be in physical waking life:
</p>
<p>
  [mY analytical mind was pinsharp, and my powers of observation farmore acute
  than my physical self possessed. At the same time I wascuriously aware that I
  was still sitting in my chair in deep meditationand I reminded myself to
  favour a ‘being state’ and not be distracted byexternal detail however novel.
</p>
<p>
  Thad no problem carrying my detached being awareness aroundwith me, despite
  that I was traveling on a train in a differentdimension. My mind was crisp and
  clear. I could have stepped easilyfrom one dimension into the next in the way
  that I would step from oneroom into another. I decided to stay and focused on
  the paintwork infront of my eyes to establish a strong foothold in this new
  territory. Ialso looked at my hands, to make sure and I was astounded by
  thedetail of my skin.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to leave the train, which was perched on a steep raisedbank, and I
  trotted light-footed to the bottom of the track. When Ilooked around I saw
  signs of human dwelling. I decided to float. Overthe years I had discovered
  that the most pleasurable way of transport is
</p>
<p>
  11 See Appendix B which explores the nature ofthese dimensions in more detail
</p>
<p>
  by allowing yourself to be carried along in an almost childlike form
  ofsurrender. This had the effect of eliminating any discomfort or fear of
  asudden fall,
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, I arrived at a busy square with people milling about,quite
  oblivious to my presence, I seemed to be blending in despitefloating about -
  but on the other hand I might simply have beeninvisible to them.
</p>
<p>
  Curiously, I sensed that while some of the people were real,others appeared to
  be more like phantoms, looking real, but changingtheir size and appearance,
  turning from female into male and visaversa,
</p>
<p>
  Thad no idea what to make of this, and if anything I felt that thiswas a
  distraction. I pondered whether I would be better off devoting MYattention to
  my meditation. In order to do so I shifted my attention backto my chair in my
  studio on which I sat meditating. I opened my eyeS
</p>
<p>
  ‘and saw Julia standing next to me asking me whether I wanted tea. INoticed
  that she was wearing an unusual dress and I was just about t©comment on it
  when I realised that I was not in the physical reality at al.
</p>
<p>
  Without waking up properly I pondered whether or not to return.to the town
  with a clear task sheet to investigate. The decision waStaken away from me
  when I opened my eyes involuntarily and samyself in an upright mediation
  position in my chair, When I looked Gs
</p>
<p>
  ~ my watch, two hours had passed. I felt an incredible peace and used itto
  deepen my meditation to enjoy Samadhi?,
</p>
<p>
  The vexing question of the composition of matter in the next dimensiondid not
  go away. I had studied what was obviously man-made snow in thenext dimension,
  conjured up solely for the purpose of spectacularentertainment. I was
  intrigued to find that when I focused my attentiondown to the crystalline
  molecular structure of the snow, just as on thePhysical level, each snowflake
  was constructed individually with their ow”unique design just as on Earth.
</p>
<p>
  Yet it was obvious that this snow had not come about as a resullsome wintery
  weather, but was clearly the result of human thought, _weather is a physical
  dimension phenomena. I came to the conclusion tha
</p>
<p>It of</p>
<p>12a state of high concentration and inner union with the universal energy</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man</p>
<p>
  nature on the next dimension responds to human intent and uses its
  ownstructure to comply and allow itself to be shaped into anything
  intentiondirects it to, by calling upon an already established matrix!?. This
  explainsthat the things we create on the next dimension by the power of
  imaginationare so incredibly real in every detail and not just a facade like
  on a filmset.
</p>
<p>
  Man, being an intimate and integral part of this ‘being state’, is notSeparate
  at all, but the individual's will on each dimension is unitedintimately and
  interacts with its higher aspects over the divide. Thiunderlined by the fact
  the on the higher dimension there is a pervadingfeeling of being ‘at home’. I
  found that often - and particularly when enteringhigher dimensions - there was
  an incredible feeling of intimacy, of havingbeen reunited with the truest
  feeling of ‘home’.
</p>
<p>Interview with a dead print-worker</p>
<p>
  6th August 20061 got up at 5 am, After meditating on the heart chakra and the
  third eyefor one hour I decided to go back to sleep.
</p>
<p>
  In my dream I wandered through the building where I used towork. I became
  aware of a young man in his late twenties walkingtowards me. He was very tall,
  at least seven feet, which struck me as
</p>
<p>=~ odd and I became aware that I was dreaming, and I burst into instant</p>
<p>
  = wakefulness. I decided to start a conversation with the man, who wasvery
  open and friendly. | asked him what he was doing, and he told methat he was
  working in the printing department. I found this verycurious and asked him
  whether he would mind showing me, as I wasinterested in the trade because of
  my profession as an artist.
</p>
<p>
  He led me to a spacious printing room with large litho presses.He told me that
  he was working at the proofing stage and he showedme some very high-quality
  proofs of intricate illustration work. Imarveled at the superb quality and
  tried to identify what it was that Iwas looking at, but then I became
  distracted by the fact that the roomcontained huge cumbersome machines. The
  fact that we were in thefifth dimension made me wonder what these machines
  could possibly
</p>
<p>
  13 The matrix contains everything that exists, has ever existed, invented or
  thought of. For more detailssee appendix B.
</p>
<p>
  be used for. A whole fifth-dimensional print and media infrastructure)was in
  front me, and it didn’t make any sense at all. J
</p>
<p>
  T contemplated the possibility that the whole environment existedonly as a
  result of the expectation and intent of this man, that he hadloved his job as
  a printer and as a result had created this printingheaven, I asked the young
  man whether he knew that he was dead, andhe confirmed the accuracy of my
  speculation. “I used to work as aPrinter when I was alive,” he said. “I still
  rather enjoy my work.”
</p>
<p>
  I looked with astonishment at the vast layout. For some reasonthe physicality
  of the environment and the scale of the plant struck meas odd, and I began to
  marvel at the power of his fantasy. Fascinated, Iexpected the whole scene to
  be just an elaborate Hollywood stage setand asked his permission to open one
  of the covers of the giantmachines to discover what was inside. To my
  astonishment I saw theengine working away inside. It had all the mechanical
  detail as if ithad existed on physical Earth. It struck me that on this
  dimension,rather than things being less mechanical and depending more
  onthought for existence, objects appeared to be even more developed thenon the
  physical dimension.
</p>
<p>
  As I chatted to the young man I noticed that his seven foot heightshrank to a
  more normal size. During our conversation he drewattention to the fact that I
  was still alive on Earth. He wonderedwhether he could ask me a favour and
  relate a message to his parentswho lived in Leeds or Liverpool, I can’t
  remember which. I suggested Ishould write it down, so I could bring the detail
  back to my physicalconsciousness. I decided to link the address and the name
  with thehouse number in one sentence to retain it better. Halfway through
  theaddress the young man changed his mind and thought it might not bea very
  good idea actually. I agreed that it could lead to all sorts ofcomplications.
</p>
<p>I then asked him what he enjoyed most about being dead. He</p>
<p>
  said the thing he enjoyed above all was the ability to fly, then he tookoff
  and flew through the open loading bay doors. I followed behind

  \and we both indulged in some terrific aerobatics. At one stage Isuggested we
  pretend to sit on an invisible armchair with our feet up,holding a drink in
  the right hand and gliding through the air, which hefound very amusing,
</p>
<p>
  At this stage I decided to investigate my novel trip into this newdimension a
  bit further and bade farewell to the printer.
</p>
<p>The following experiences led me through three higher levels.</p>
<p>
  I was frustrated by the limitations of the lower level. Although Isaw many
  people from different eras involved in different activities, Ifound it
  difficult to relate. The most prominent scenes were of peopleindulging in
  various kinds of amusement like the staging of life historyevents and
  nostalgic fairs going back several centuries. I saw people inperiod costumes
  as well as visitors in contemporary clothing. Thewhole area was like a large
  amusement park and very busy, which afterawhile I found rather tiresome and
  pedestrian.
</p>
<p>
  As I walked towards some houses and entered narrow streets, I wasattracted to
  a bigger building, which I entered. Standing in the porch I sawa young woman
  looking downcast. I asked her if I could help her in someway. She told me she
  was very bored and unhappy with the scenery andwished she could be somewhere
  else. I suggested to her that there where
</p>
<p>
  = higher levels we could visit, which offered more creative power andfreedom
  and were less restrictive. She told me she didn’t know how toleave this place,
  because she didn’t know where to go.
</p>
<p>
  I remembered from previous experiences that there was apsychological barrier.
  which prevented you entering the higher planesbefore you overcame it. This was
  often represented by a physical
</p>
<p>
  .= barrier like a ceiling. I suggested that she followed me so that we
  couldfind a way out of this plane.
</p>
<p>
  We walked up the stairs until we reached the attic. I startedremoving the
  plaster of the ceiling and pushed the joists away with mybare hands until I
  had created a hole in the ceiling. I helped the girlclimb though the hole into
  the open, and then followed after her. To oursurprise we found ourselves in an
  open field, and the first thing Irecognised was that the atmosphere was much
  more pleasant and thelight much brighter. The girl cheered up immediately and
  skippedthrough the field. I thought it was time to investigate my new
</p>
<p>
  environment, but I was labored in flight. I then remembered thetechnique
  suggested by William Buhlman’s: simply, to commandyourself. I said “Fly,” and
  soared immediately high into the sky.
</p>
<p>
  I soon lost sight of the girl. When I looked down I became awarethat the
  environment had an element of artificiality about it, like thecomputer
  generated images I created in physical working life. I realisedthen that I was
  drifting through a void which contained only the
</p>
<p>
  © subconscious projections of my mind: the world I was flying throughwas
  created literally ‘on the hoof’, or ‘on the wing’, as it were. As I gotcloser
  to the ground I noticed how flimsy it appeared: all thin veils -very
  insubstantial.
</p>
<p>
  With curiosity I pondered how my experience of working life hadstarted to
  tinge the environment of this dimension, which assumedmore and more of what I
  expected to see - namely a computer-
</p>
<p>
  1" Senerated artificial world. With a feeling of disappointment I woke upand
  pondered the nature of reality.
</p>
<p>
  Contacting the dead5th January 2003I started meditation at 5.30 am. After a
  couple of hours I shifted myattention to the _hypothalamus, in the centre of
  my brain. Almostinstantly I became aware of a strong energy stream and withinf
  Moments I had dual awareness, with part of me aware of sitting inL meditation,
  and the other part becoming detached. I shiftedinstinctively towards my
  detached self and allowed myself to float upand out of my body until I reached
  the ceiling. Then I descended gently‘back into my body.
</p>
<p>
  Keeping my awareness focused firmly on my other self I left mybody again and
  looked out of the window. It was a beautiful frostymorning with the sun just
  about to creep over the horizon. The colourswere much more luxurious and
  heavenly than one would expect to seewith normal physical sight at this time
  of day. I was tempted to ventureoutside and wondered what it would be like to
  go through the wall.Although I felt no resistance, I was uncomfortable with
  the darkness
</p>
<p>15 Out-of-body practitioner and author of “Adventures Beyond the Body”15</p>
<p>
  i eXand decided to use the more familiar route through the closed window,and
  just like had done in the past I went through it with a familiar
</p>
<p>
  op’.I floated gently down onto the patio at the back of our house andenjoyed
  the beautiful glint of the frosty ground and the white needlesof grass, which
  were invigorated by dancing particles of light that hadbeen bounced into
  action by the rising sun. It was a breathtaking\ display of energy, enhanced
  further by the fact I was super-awake, in a
</p>
<p>state of consciousness so lucid, crisp and aware that it made my normal</p>
<p>Tife appear like a dream,</p>
<p>
  Exuberantly, I floated towards roof level and, overcome bycuriosity, decided
  to go back into my studio to take a look at my bodysitting in the chair
  meditating.
</p>
<p>This was a strange experience. Instead of finding my body</p>
<p>
  y Upright in meditation, I saw that it was slumped forward as if I hadCiozed
  off. It struck me as a pitiful sight.
</p>
<p>
  As I got closer, I was amused to see how rough I looked: I'd gonestraight from
  bed to my meditation chair, and I was sitting thereuntidily in my dressing
  gown without a flicker of dignity. I got withinsix inches of my face,
  wondering if I could improve my appearance,perhaps by trimming my beard or
  shaving it off altogether. Then Idecided to slip back into my body, to see
  again what it was like fromthe other side. ! accomplished this without the
  slightest discomfort.
</p>
<p>
  Having body awareness again, I decided not to retum tomeditation, but instead
  to indulge a little more in my bodiless state.Focusing on my hypothalamus, I
  re-established dual awarenessquickly; then, shifting my focus into my subtle
  self, I became aware of a
</p>
<p>
  »- Strong energy current. I decided to allow myself to be carried out andaway
  from my body until I hovered about two hundred feet above asmall, but
  unfamiliar town.
</p>
<p>
  As I landed in the street I noticed a number of people going abouttheir
  business without paying any attention to me. I took a few elegantfloating
  steps, touching down with one foot, pushing myself off theground, floating
  about fifteen feet up into the air and landing on theother foot like a ballet
  dancer in low gravity. I delighted in the childishpleasure, and thought with
  great amusement what other people would
</p>
<p>
  think of this old fool. But nobody else even saw me, I was invisible toall
  people around me, and there were quite a few of them.
</p>
<p>
  I considered the fact that this was not the physical dimension atall, but a
  counterpart close to the physical - a place where the newly +dead lived, as
  well as those still attached to more earthly concerns and +where dreamers
  would stray into. I could feel that I was on a slightlyhigher vibratory rate,
  which rendered me invisible to the inhabitants.To test my theory I approached
  a young lady in a blue floral dress andasked, “Can you see me?”
</p>
<p>
  She looked startled in my direction, but seemed to be lookingstraight through
  me. Obviously, she was aware of my presence andmay have heard me.
</p>
<p>There was a touch of anxiety in her reply, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>
  Thad no idea how to make myself visible to her, so, not wantingto alarm or
  spook her, I focused all the power of love I could drawupon on her, which
  brought a reassuring smile to her face. I was awareinstantly of the benefit it
  had on her and how uplifted she felt. Then shecalled to her friend: “Can you
  see him?”
</p>
<p>
  1 appeared to flicker in and out of her vision like some ghostlyapparition and
  had a distinct impression of her experience andPerception of me as well as of
  her feelings towards me. It was only thenthat I noticed her friend, who looked
  straight at me, but did not appearto see me, although I knew she too was aware
  of my presence.
</p>
<p>
  Being unable to figure out how to make myself visible, I thoughtit would be
  best to move on. I decided to kiss the lady in the blue dresson her forehead
  by pouring the love and affection into her. She smiled,teplied with a
  thrilling affection and I departed.
</p>
<p>
  I was stunned by the power of the feelings I could generatemerely by intention
  and thought how difficult it would be tol‘communicate such powerful emotion on
  the physical level.
</p>
<p>
  I ventured into the town centre, by which time I had adapted tomy surroundings
  and was clearly visible to other people. Lookingaround, trying to find
  familiar features, I felt slightly disappointed thatthis town was not much
  different to any town on Earth, Theatmosphere, however, appeared to be less
  intense. When I came to alady Tunning a large sweet stall I decided to strike
  up a conversation“Can I try one of your lovely looking chocolates?” I asked.
</p>
<p>“Please help yourself,” she replied.</p>
<p>“What about money?” I asked.</p>
<p>
  She laughed and replied: “All you have to do is ask,. That is allthe payment I
  need.”
</p>
<p>
  Tenquired whether she had marzipan. She pointed to a large trayand said: “They
  are over there.”
</p>
<p>
  I took a piece of chocolate-covered marzipan. It wasn’t anythingspecial, but
  not bad either. With a heartfelt thank you I departed anddecided to explore
  this level a little further.
</p>
<p>
  As I moved through the town I noticed that some of the houseslooked rather
  neglected. One district I strayed into looked decidedlybleak. Other parts were
  much more friendly, with restaurants, shopsand pubs. I was surprised by the
  fact that the nice and not so nice partsof the town were not that far apart,
  just like on Earth - another sign thatthis dimension was clearly very closely
  linked to our physical world.
</p>
<p>
  People were socialising in the streets. Although the atmospherewas very
  Earth-like, it was also quite different. There seemed to bemore interaction
  between the people than on Earth, and there was arather more lethargic
  attitude to the place. Yet so far I had not comeacross anything that would
  make this town a particularly attractiveplace to live.
</p>
<p>
  T addressed a lady who appeared to be in her late thirties: “Howlong have you
  lived here?”
</p>
<p>“For ages,” she replied.</p>
<p>“Do you like it here?” I said.</p>
<p>
  A “I do get a bit bored sometimes, but I don’t know where else to‘settle. It's
  not the most exciting place.”
</p>
<p>
  As I looked around | felt I had to agree with her. This was a drablittle
  place.
</p>
<p>
  I decided it was best to leave and wondered what method I coulduse to get into
  a higher, more pleasant and interesting dimension. Irecalled that in the past
  I had achieved this by entering a building andrising to underneath the roof
  and going through it. I was well aware ofthe fact that this was a
  psychological crutch, a technique usingvisualisation and not the best or most
  learned way to go aboutachieving my aim, but I had no better idea what those
  better means
</p>
<p>
  were. Meditation and chanting was certainly an alternative, but thisusually
  brought unexpected results.
</p>
<p>
  Tentered a large empty house and did what I had done beforeand floated up
  towards the ceiling. Having pushed myself though, Ifound myself in another
  room. The room was much brighter with aclean white carpet embroidered with an
  ornate golden pattern. Thewalls changed as I looked at them and to my great
  disappointment thebeauty of the room faded until I found myself standing in
  just anotherdrab and ordinary room.
</p>
<p>
  I considered whether I should call for help to raise me to a higherdimensional
  level, but decided instead to leave the room via a doorleading into a long
  hall. When I opened the door at the far end of thehall I walked onto the roof
  of a large multi-storey building, like a hugeblock of flats. The building was
  empty, neglected and needingattention. Litter was scattered everywhere.
</p>
<p>
  T made a huge jump to an adjacent building at least ten metersaway. This
  building looked much better kept, and I was welcomed by agirl in her late
  teens. Although she looked young, her demeanor wasthat of a much older woman.
</p>
<p>
  “Hi,” I greeted her. Then I asked straight out: “How old were youwhen you
  died?” I felt it was unnecessary to introduce myself as shehad already sized
  me up.
</p>
<p>“Iwas eighty-five,” she answered.</p>
<p>“So you are really a little old lady,” I said, smiling affectionately.</p>
<p>
  “I suppose I am,” she said charmingly. I warmed to herimmediately. She was
  little more than five feet tall, very pretty withshortish curly blond hair.
  She had warmth and kindness in her eyes.
</p>
<p>“Do you live here on your own?" I wanted to know.</p>
<p>
  “No, Ihave a friend who used to be a history teacher. His name isArthur. He
  hasn’t been here a very long time.”
</p>
<p>
  T saw a man in his early forties waving to us. He was a little fullaround his
  waist, but had a friendly smile. He came over and shookhands with me. There
  was something about his personality and theway he spoke that I found
  distinctly uninspiring. I had the feeling thatif I stayed I would get bored
  very quickly and so sought an excuse toleave. He must have felt my discomfort.
</p>
<p>
  “Wait,” he said. “I must show you something very interesting. Ihave discovered
  a way of teaching children history in a very fascinatingway.”
</p>
<p>
  He opened a book with nice illustrations of an ancient Greekscene, He told me
  that he could manipulate the drawings with histhoughts and the pictures would
  move like a film.
</p>
<p>
  Tlooked at him and pointed out that back at home we called thismultimedia, but
  I admitted that his version looked quite sophisticated.I looked on as he
  animated the characters in the illustrations with histhoughts and wondered
  whether he knew that I was an illustrator whoearned his living producing 3d
  computer graphics and_animations. Ibegan to feel a little bit impatient with
  his demonstration as he movedlittle characters about pointlessly in his book.
</p>
<p>
  I apologised to the couple and told them that my time waslimited and that I
  had to leave, but that I would come back if theywanted me to.
</p>
<p>
  “No, we don't,” they replied to my utter astonishment. Then theyboth burst
  into a broad grin: “Of course we would like you to.”
</p>
<p>“What is your name,” I asked the eighty-five year old teenager.</p>
<p>“Lam Maha," she said.</p>
<p>
  I asked her to repeat it several times because I had never heardsuch a name
  before and I thought I would not remember it. I gave her agentle and warm hug,
  then waved good-bye to the couple and left.
</p>
<p>
  I descended to the main street, which was deserted. Some of thebig buildings
  looked as if they had never been finished. I wonderedwhether the little old
  lady had lived most of her life in a block of flats,maybe in London, and I
  could see why, in this case, she felt comfortableliving in a high-rise
  building. Although I knew this place was not farremoved from the worldly
  dimension and limited in scope, she hadmanaged to create for herself and her
  boyfriend a pleasant enoughenvironment, maybe nicer even than her flat on
  Earth. I couldn’t seeany reason why someone who had lived happily all their
  life in a largeblock of flats would want to change anything after they died.
</p>
<p>
  As I came to a deserted square a little further down the street, Inoticed that
  the sky had become covered in dark billowing clouds withred flashes of
  lightening darting through them. The whole atmospherehad taken on a rather
  end-of-the-world type feeling.
</p>
<p>
  I realised that I had an increased power of awareness and anuncanny intuitive
  knowledge of reading what I saw. It had been a longtime since I had had such
  an intensive, prolonged excursion through adimension so close to our Earth's.
</p>
<p>
  I had knowledge without needing to think about or deduce —anything. I knew
  that those mountainous clouds were the result ofcombined negative thoughts
  coming from the Earth, darkening thelight for the people living in this
  region. I realised that the power of ouremotions and thoughts had an effect
  much more pronounced than wecould ever imagine.
</p>
<p>
  As I stared into the sky and watched the changes, I had a feelingof impending
  war. I imagined other visitors of this world reading themas an omen of great
  evil, which would befall mankind, and indeed, tomy dismay, I realised I was
  doing the same thing. There was simply noother way of interpreting the clouds.
  I could read the situation like anopen book. I could see anger, unrest and
  hostility. I was fascinated by it,but very disturbed 16,
</p>
<p>
  I decided it was time to return to my body and to purify my mind 4by deepening
  my meditation. When I did so, I kept my eyes closed fora few moments. Then I
  looked at my watch: I had spent just over anhour in the other dimension.
</p>
<p>
  I felt very relaxed and detached, so I decided to return. Imeditated for about
  ten minutes and when I became aware of my newsurrounding I was on a quite
  different dimension.
</p>
<p>
  I was in the middle of a large hall surrounded by a throng in themidst of
  organising a great party: a massive social event involvingthousands of people.
  I thought of interviewing a woman who seemedto be one of the main organisers,
  but she was busy with a large groupof girls rehearsing a spectacular dance
  routine.
</p>
<p>
  As a choreographer she had her hands full. There were severalage groups of
  people numbering hundreds. They all had her attentionand I quickly worked out
  how she managed to organise such a massivegroup. All the participants had to
  do was to tune into her mind andsurrender to her ideas and she directed them
  with the same ease as aconductor directs his orchestra. It was impressive how
  organized,
</p>
<p>
  16 Itis worth pointing out that this was two months before the onset of the
  Iraq war.
</p>
<p>
  professional and accomplished every individual dancer was and howmuch in tune
  they were with each other.
</p>
<p>
  In other areas people worked together with dancers creatingfascinating
  colourful costumes, some of them extending for severalmeters beyond their
  bodies. I could see instantly what their purposewas. When they moved in
  certain ways, as organised by anotherchoreographer, they created a colossal
  living picture which was foreverchanging with new glorious and mind-blowing
  results. But this wasnot all. The individual dancers could change the colours
  of theircostumes, even their appearance, simply by thought. I could imaginehow
  such sophisticated art forms could inspire a future opening at ourEarthly
  Olympics. It was extraordinary how enthusiastic and dedicatedthe participants
  were and how powerful the feeling of the communalspirit conveyed itself at the
  heart of it all.
</p>
<p>
  But on the whole, despite the excitement and activity, it onlyserved to
  inspire me to leave this region and move to something moresublime, but instead
  I returned to my body. Another hour had passed. Imade tea.
</p>
<p>
  Do the dead have supermarkets?27th April 1976Having achieved full waking
  consciousness, I found myself standing inthe middle of a department store. |
  was amused by the fact that I couldbuy things. I could even steal things
  without having to experience theconsequences. I browsed through the store,
  pondering what to pinch. Isaw a woman sitting at a checkout desk - she was the
  only personstaffing a till.Irummaged through my pocket and pulled out a few
  coins. “CanT use these?” I asked innocently, slightly amused by having
  unearthedcoins without even thinking about it in this nonphysical world.
  Shetutted and told me that my money was of no use here. She showed mea
  currency I had never seen before. They resembled strange foreign= coins with
  holes in their middle and I wondered wether she waspulling my leg. Slightly
  bewildered, I said I would look around a bitmore, to see what I could find. In
  fact, I planned to make a polite
</p>
<p>
  disappearance. This was not the most novel place to spend my timewhen out of
  my body.
</p>
<p>
  “Let me talk to the store manager and ask him if he can make anexception,” she
  insisted.
</p>
<p>
  Persuaded by her quite charming demeanor and attractiveappearance I followed
  her through the store into a hall where we met afew young men, in their mid
  twenties, perhaps. They were veryfriendly and we all went into a resting room
  next to some other offices.Looking around I noticed that the room was not
  really furnished verytastefully. It was three to four meters square with white
  washed walls,like a typical staff room you may find in any office on earth.
  There wasa sofa and two arm chairs. One of them even looked slightly worn.
  Thecurtains too had obviously not been given a great deal of consideration.It
  had the feel of a bachelor’s pad, with no attention spent on its decor.
</p>
<p>
  I felt slightly amused that this could have been somebody'sdream I had entered
  - maybe the check-out girl’s, who would then tellher friends at work the next
  day, “had such a strange dream that I wasat work, but I was the only person at
  the checkouts and there was onlyone customer, trying to pay with foreign
  money!”
</p>
<p>
  I thought it would be worthwhile to let events unfold and findout what it was
  like to be a part of somebody's dream. At the same timeI wanted to test the
  creative potential of dreams and to see whether Icould influence the scene
  simply by thought.
</p>
<p>
  I began chatting to the other men. The atmosphere was relaxed,and we joked and
  laughed. I thought it was time to put thought powerto the test, so I proposed
  we have a drink and suggested wine, whichthey welcomed enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
  I closed my eyes and willed two bottles of wine, whichmaterialised on the
  floor. To my utter surprise and disappointment Ifound that the bottles were
  empty. The response was slight amusementand I wondered whether it was easier
  to produce a glass of wineinstead of a bottle. Instantly a glass appeared in
  my hand and in thehand of one of the men, who I thought of as the shop
  manager.
</p>
<p>
  When I tasted it I was disappointed again. It was a cheap, poorquality wine,
  very sweet and more like juice.
</p>
<p>
  I concluded that this dimension was very low, and close to thephysical world.
  Everything here was rather substandard and poor.
</p>
<p>
  T asked the man holding the other glass: “Are you happy livinghere. Would you
  not prefer to live in a nicer place than this strangecity.”
</p>
<p>
  “T think this place is alright,” he answered. “Why? Where wouldyou like to
  go?”
</p>
<p>
  “I can imagine a nice tidy little village in the country,” I said.“Somewhere
  better than this mundane place.”
</p>
<p>
  Tnoticed a real irritation in his voice when he answered me: “Youprobably
  belong to the kind of people who think they are better thaneveryone else.”
</p>
<p>
  He opened the curtains and I saw that we overlooked asomewhat gloomy harbor
  with a few rundown ships. The water lookedblack. Beyond I could see wide open
  country stretching out into thedistance. I could see what looked like igloos
  made out of lightsurrounding habitats. As I focused my view and zoomed in I
  couldmake out the outlines of a rather picturesque village, which was
  reallyQuite attractive. Without further ado I gave my apologies and
  leftthrough the window. I heard laughter from the people I left behind.
</p>
<p>
  For a moment I sailed like a bird towards the village, flying abouttwo hundred
  meters above the ground. Then I noticed anuncomfortable heaviness and starting
  losing altitude. 1 sunk deeperuntil I took a nosedive and crashed into a
  ground. At that moment Iopened my physical eyes.
</p>
<p>
  Upon waking I was keen to identify the physical equivalent of the placeThad
  just visited. It felt like Shoreham harbor, although everything had beenout of
  alignment - the store, the harbor and the countryside; and yet I wassure that
  the place was Shoreham. I wondered who of the people I had metwere dead, i.e.
  permanent inhabitants of that place, and who were merelydreamers; or whether
  it was a ‘consensus’ environment, created by livingPeople who worked in
  ordinary life and whose habitual thoughts andfeelings had created the
  environment on the next dimension close to physicalEarth: an ordinary world,
  devoid of great ambition or imagination. Would Ihave recognised any of the
  dreamers if met them during the day?
</p>
<p>
  The ‘onion skin’ theory of dimensions sprang to mind when I thoughthow places
  had their counterparts in other dimensions. The idea is that thecloser the
  skin of the dimension is to Earth (which is the innermost layer), the
</p>
<p>
  more closely it resembles its physical counterpart. Higher up - or further
  out+ it becomes the case that many other influences work on the place until
  itbears no or very little resemblance to its physical counterpart. In this
  case, theonly way to recognise a place is by its atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  Very recently I visited the dimensional counterpart of Sandbanks
  nearBournemouth, where my wife and I had just spent a week's holiday toretrace
  our youth when we first met. On this dimension, Sandbanks wastransformed so
  much that there were no physical characteristics left thatallowed you to
  recognise it by its appearance. Perhaps the only thing thesame was that it was
  at the sea. Instead of the densely populated area ofhouses there was a very
  attractive mountain with many elaborate pathwaysup it, some half carved into
  the mountain with a beautiful ornate banisterrunning along them. The most
  fascinating view was out towards the sea.There were numerous islands jutting
  out of the water: some steep mountains,others low and gentle, but all arranged
  in perfect symmetry.
</p>
<p>
  On some islands there were bright flashing orbs of light, which I
  soondiscovered were people. There were no features left that would tell me
  that Iwas in Sandbanks, Bournemouth, and yet there was no mistaking that I
  wasthere.
</p>
<p>Do they know they are dead?</p>
<p>
  27th May 1976I meditated from 5.30 to 6.45 in the morning. Shortly after, I
  nodded offto sleep and woke up in my subtle body. I got out of bed and walked
  tothe window, but instead of looking out of the first floor window intothe
  back yard of the house, where we lived at that time, I found myselfon the
  ground floor overlooking a garden, which was stockedabundantly with plants and
  shrubs. I climbed out of the window inorder to explore it, but because I_was
  fully awake, 1 hesitated,wondering what people might think seeing me climb out
  of thewindow. There was a moment when I wasn’t quite sure whether or notI
  might actually be in my physical body. But when I landed softly, like
  afeather, on the ground, I realised that I was in another dimension. Thisworld
  was quite different to what I was accustomed to. I delighted inthe garden as I
  walked towards the gate at the far end, which led to theroad.
</p>
<p>
  ‘My first thought was that I must have been on a lower dimension,close to
  physical level. I saw people riding bicycles and driving carsalong the road.
  This was clearly a world where people continued their
</p>
<p>-_ habits of physical life.</p>
<p>
  I followed the road for twenty metres until I came to a T-junction.I turned
  right at an old building. Three children were playing in thestreet. A rather
  mischievous boy teased a girl of about seven, for whomI felt very sorry. She
  seemed to have some kind of skin disease. Iwondered what children were doing
  on this rather average, Earth-likeplace. If they were dead children I felt
  they surely belonged to a nicerplace on grounds of their relative innocence. I
  felt rather puzzled aboutthe harshness of this life, where children appeared
  to be suffering
</p>
<p>
  © diseases and the little tortures of everyday life. But I realised theymight,
  of course, just be dreaming children.
</p>
<p>
  T then felt a strong gust of wind and I wondered about the natureof weather
  and why it should be here and whether it served a purpose.What kind of energy
  was wind and what brought it about? In someway, I didn’t expect the
  physicality of this plane to be as I experiencedit on Earth. As I continued
  along the street I rather playfully jumpedonto a low wall where I continued my
  walk. The cars going past ratherannoyed me and I was disappointed by how
  closely this placeresembled physical Earth. Almost in every detail it seemed
  to echo ourphysicalness. I even saw fallen leaves drifting about in a
  mundane,Earth-like way. Some of the grass had lost its freshness and looked
  dry.T yearned for some unspoiled nature, some other dimensional heaven,rather
  than this dull copy of Earth. Fortunately, as I walked further, Icould see
  meadows and a forest in the distance.
</p>
<p>
  Just then a woman passed by on a bicycle. She said hello to me,and I thought
  it was a good opportunity to talk to one of theinhabitants and to find out a
  little more about their world. I ran to catchup with her. I was amazed at my
  feather steps and the tremendousspeed I gathered so quickly. She noticed me
  and turned round, giggled,and increased her speed. When I stopped pursuing her
  she stoppedtoo, turned round and gave me a broad, mischievous smile, To
  mysurprise she then echoed my thoughts, saying that she too wanted toget away
  from the town and go into the forest. She continued to smileat me, I knew she
  was sending me up, somehow reading my thoughts,
</p>
<p>
  but she was very pleasant. I decided to interrogate her, but just when Iopened
  my mouth she disappeared into thin air. I looked around,calling her, but she
  had gone. I felt quite disappointed.
</p>
<p>
  Next thing, a young man approached me. I could feel instantlyand not without
  some amazement that he was jealous. I noticedsuddenly the young woman had
  returned and was now sitting in thegrass, smirking at me. I turned towards the
  man.
</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” I said. “Do you mind me asking you a fewquestions?”</p>
<p>“Well?” he said, not as friendlily as I had hoped.</p>
<p>
  “Could you please tell me where we are - what kind of realm weare in?” He
  looked at me, almost puzzled, and gave me a name whichsounded like a place.
  “No, no,” I said. “I mean what sort of level are wein? What level of
  existence? I mean, there are different worlds, differentdimensions...” He
  didn’t seem to grasp my question, and other youngpeople arrived as I was
  trying to explain myself. Soon there was a smallgroup. I noticed some wore
  ordinary T-shirts. I tried to explain thatthere is Earth, and then there are
  places where people go after theyhave died, and that this was one of those
  places.
</p>
<p>“Who is he?” someone asked. | introduced myself.</p>
<p>
  “Lam only a temporary visitor from Earth,” I said. They looked atme as if I
  was some loony who had escaped from a mental asylum. Tomy relief, one of the
  boys came forward and asked where I thought Iwas. But then the rest of the
  group crowded him out until he waspushed to one side. I explained to them that
  this is not the only placethey could live - that there were much nicer spots,
  places filled withlight and lush green fields. Did they know that they were
  dead, andhad they ever considered the fact that things were quite different
  towhat they were used to? I persisted in telling them that there were
  nicerplaces than this that they could visit if they wanted, which were
  muchbrighter, happier and cheerful.
</p>
<p>
  My words started a discussion among them. I left them to sort outtheir
  thoughts and walked around the debating group until I got to theyoung man they
  had pushed out. I held him softly by the arm. I feltvery warm and
  compassionate towards him and he responded to me.Somehow he knew what I was
  talking about and he smiled. I had thedistinct feeling that none of the other
  people here had yet realised that
</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man.</p>
<p>
  they had died and that all of them had taken their new condition forgranted,
  like anyone would accept their new life in new conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Then I felt I dryness in my mouth and had a funny feeling as ifmy teeth were
  stuck together. I returned to my body.
</p>
<p>
  I thought a lot about this experience afterwards. Does everybody knowafter
  they have died that they are dead? Is there always an automaticreception on
  the other side, as I have read about? Relatives and friends whocome to welcome
  you and introduce you to your new place? What if thereisn’t? The dimension I
  visited was not that different from our Earthdimension. What if people just
  die and find themselves in an alternativeuniverse, hardly noticing the
  difference and adjusting just as they would ifthey moved to another town?
  Would they not get accustomed to it in thesame way? So what if they can fly or
  travel faster? People can adapt toanything, We cannot explain everything in
  life. We can’t explain some of themost ordinary things, such as what we are
  and why we are here. If we can’tfind any answers, we just accept it. And why
  not accept the fact that we candisappear and reappear in another place? Did
  they suffer some form ofamnesia, where they couldn’t remember their earth
  life, only this one? May
</p>
<p>
  ow [REY Petiops have assumed that their earth life was justa dream and-nawthey
  had returned to their real life?
</p>
<p>
  T recalled the incredible ease with which I crossed over into otherdimensions
  at times, and having to test whether it was physical or not as aresult. I
  wondered whether nature is really concerned with making sure thatwe are looked
  after once we reach the other side, or if it just leaves us to ourown devices.

<p>
  1th July 1976 ~ A night out in the fifth dimension of BournemouthThis was
  probably my longest and most vivid experience in anotherdimension to date. It
  was so intense and profound that I wished I couldhave had breaks in order to
  note down all of the detail of thisextraordinary journey into the higher
  dimension. I remember leaving
</p>
<p>my body shortly after going to sleep at about midnight. For the whole</p>
<p>night - at le hours - I went about the town, and a number of other</p>
<p>
  places too. It was as if I had walked out of my front door and straightinto
  another dimension.
</p>
<p>
  Walking along the road in Boscombe, I approached a woman andasked her where I
  was. She understood my question instantly andinformed me without hesitation
  that I was on the third level - or thirddimension - from_the physical_plane.
  However, the people Iencountered were still very much involved in Earth-like
  activities, andthe environment appeared to be very ‘down-to-earth’, with few
  novelfeatures to distinguish it from Earth. I decided to go about my visit
  andto adopt a somewhat scientific approach by trying to find out moreabout the
  actual nature of this dimension.
</p>
<p>
  Because of the extensive period I spent there I gained valuableinformation and
  insight. My studies were conducted rationally, in thesame way you would go
  about studying events happening on thephysical level. I felt under no pressure
  to hurry, but there was almosttoo much to do and at times I got swept away by
  events and was
</p>
<p>
  — unable to imprint them on my memory and was left with onlyimpressions of
  results.My first impression was that everything revolved around more orless
  Earth-like activities. People here, those who had been alivepreviously, had
  settled more or less into pursuing similar interests thatthey had when alive,
  but with the added pleasures that leisure has tooffer when you have enhanced
  abilities to fulfill your desires. Thesepeople were able to create very
  agreeable environments,Tconducted my own experiments of creative thought. It
  appearedthat the power of my thoughts was much more in evidence here thanon
  the level closer to Planet Earth, meaning that I could influenceobjects and
  events by thought much more easily than when I tried mywine stunt in the
  supermarket. I also made the curious discovery thatE intentional thought was
  less powerful than thought arising naturally
</p>
<p>
  out_of expectation. Spontaneous thought also appeared to be morepowerful than
  designed thought, almost as if its energy was taken froma higher level.
  Intending to create something via thought could belaborious and led often to
  poor results.
</p>
<p>
  ‘An even more powerful way of creating comes about with passionatethought. It
  is like supercharging an engine. Desire seems to be the ke
</p>
<p>Multi</p>
<p>imensional Man</p>
<p>
  helps dramatically in the fulfillment of people's dreams. People for
  obviousTeason regard this as a kind of Heaven, like a lottery jackpot win. It
  is easy tounderstand that a general atmosphere of happiness and goodwill
  comesabout when everyone is ‘living the dream’. In such places there is
  aneagerness to party and to share joy. People are generally very friendly
  andaccommodating, also much more tolerant and forgiving than people appearon
  Planet Earth. Reality of this ‘worldly’ paradise should, as I havementioned
  before, appeal to anybody who plays the lottery and dreamsabout the big win
  and a life in luxury.
</p>
<p>
  There are, however, things we can do in physical life that will greatlyenhance
  the enjoyment of our pleasure in other dimensions. Simply byspending our time
  here more effectively, by learning certain skills which willgreatly enhance
  our pleasures, we can achieve great happiness after death orin dreams. One
  thing I have found necessary to learn in order to enjoy myselfmore fully on
  the next dimension is an attitude of generosity and po: ty.On that dimension,
  such characteristics enhance our capacity for enjoymentexponentially, while
  mean-spiritedness and negativity will hinder us to reachthis level. It appears
  that any activity that directs attention towards givingand enhancing happiness
  and pleasure to others will create the psychologicalset-up in ourselves to
  open the floodgates for receiving pleasure on thehigher dimensions. This
  becomes very obvious when studying life on thisrealm.
</p>
<p>
  The other thing I was keen to investigate, because it was such abig part of
  the reality of the higher dimensions, was modes of“transport. Traveling via
  thinking is only possible if you know the placeyou wish to visit. The only
  other way of moving about, other thanwalking, floating or flying, is by
  focusing on a landmark in the distanceand then appearing spontaneously at the
  spot in the blink of an eye. Idiscovered this, when I became frustrated about
  my unsatisfactoryflying efforts. When I saw a tree in the distance and wished
  to be there Ifound myself there instantly.Another experiment I carried out was
  to see how easy it was to© Penetrate solid objects. I talked to a young lady,
  after introducingmyself as a visitor from Planet Earth, about how easy it was
  to dealwith solid objects in her world, Slightly amused, she looked at me,
  thenassumed a Kung Fu pose and with her bare hand chopped cleanly
</p>
<p>
  through a solid wooden post with a theatrical shout, bringing a big grinto my
  face. Although nearly a foot thick, the post offered no resistanceand she left
  no sign of damage, leaving it still in one piece. I hadassumed the right of
  will would have seen it tumble to the ground. Ibraced myself to try a similar
  experiment, but instead of using awooden post I tried my luck on a solid stone
  wall. My fist met the walland passed straight through, but not without
  encountering a rubbery
</p>
<p>= kind of resistance.</p>
<p>
  I started to relax. I no longer felt the urgency of the excursion. Ifelt as if
  1 could relax with all the time in the world and enjoy my staylike I would do
  on holiday back on Earth. The serenity of being inanother dimension with
  enhanced clarity of mind and wakefulalertness was almost overwhelming.
  Pondering the fact that I was inanother reality in another world filled me
  with great joy, excitementand anticipation. I was so alert and awake that I
  did not even have toworry about drifting into sleep or having to focus my
  attention onmaintaining waking consciousness. Simply, I had arrived on a
  differentplane, and I was myself. For a moment I wondered whether J had been—
  careless and had severed my connection with my body for good and
</p>
<p>had entered the land of the dead, but that wasn’t the case. I could feel</p>
<p>
  p the luminous laser like fibre of my connecting cord dangling from theback of
  my head like a limp, thin thread. There was no pull to returnback to my
  physical self.
</p>
<p>
  Presently, I was walking down the higher dimensionalcounterpart of
  Christchurch Road in Boscombe, Bournemouth, nearwhere we lived. Again it
  wasn’t the landmarks that made me recognisethe place, rather the atmosphere.
  Although I knew clearly the road Iwas in, the buildings were all different.
  There was an unhurried qualityof life here. It was friendly and peaceful. This
  was indeed the place tohave holidays: the super holiday resort.
</p>
<p>
  ‘There were bars and ‘shops’, which were more like little gallerieswhere the
  owner could display their creative skill. I saw a shop whichhad very novel
  glass and crystal four-poster and other beds on display.On the physical level
  they would have struck me as uncomfortable, butwithout body mass weight to
  worry about, I could imagine that crystalcould have a very invigorating effect
  on the spirit.
</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>
  Attracted by loud noise and a jovial atmosphere, I strayed into anearby pub. I
  thought it would be good to get more involved with thelocals. People enjoy
  themselves in bars on Earth, especially whenalcohol lowers their inhibitions,
  but the people here had takenenjoyment onto another level altogether. They
  interacted free-spiritedlyand were amazingly relaxed around one another. This
  pub in particularwas a very vibrant place. I saw people frolicking and
  flirtingprovocatively in front of everyone else without any self-consciousness
</p>
<p>
  towns whatsoever. The absence of inhibition and a prevailing feeling
  ofsolidarity, friendship and_intimacy was something I had neverexperienced
  before. There was certainly a feeling of sewuality in the air:the atmosphere
  tingled with it. | saw a woman not wearing a top quiteopenly showing her
  ‘affection’ to her aroused boyfriend. There wassomething liberating about the
  absence of any scruples. This was agroup where everyone was in agreement: they
  all enjoyed the jovialand free-spirited atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  Still very conscious of my ‘scientific’ intentions, I thought toventure into a
  more sociological form of study. I asked a man next tome whether there were
  any problems with morality in this world,whether anyone ever took offence to
  what happened here. A fewpeople around me responded as if I had just posted
  the most ridiculousquestion in the world. To my utter astonishment, but to the
  greatamusement of the others, two men took out their penises and blewthem up
  to ridiculous proportions. Encouraged by such amusement,and with the power of
  their strange imagination, they twisted andcontorted their sexual organs into
  the most ludicrous shapes. Then the
</p>
<p>| women joined in and competed with each other by changing their bare</p>
<p>
  breast into any kind of fruit that one could think of. The hilarity of
  thedisplay was very contagious and like everyone else I fell aboutlaughing.
</p>
<p>
  Soon the whole pub was engaged in the game. I was laughing somuch that I felt
  I would not be able to stop.
</p>
<p>
  Gradually it all calmed down and I wanted to know whether Itoo had the power
  to change my shape. With an effort of will I grewmyself to about ten feet
  tall, accompanied by loud cheering andapplause from the crowd.
</p>
<p>
  My conclusion was that these people had no problems enjoyingtheir body and
  sexuality. They were all in it together. There was nobodywho would object,
  because they were attracted to each other simply byfunctioning on the same
  level.
</p>
<p>
  1 left the pub and decided to explore other parts of the town. Ihad read many
  books on life after death and there appeared to be aconsensus among the
  authors that night was something that simplycould not exist. I was surprised
  to find when walking through thestreet, still on the same counterpart of
  Bournemouth, that it was nighttime, But maybe it was not night time at all,
  and more like a dim, notunpleasant light. It felt like a rather warm glow of
  intimacy andcomfort,
</p>
<p>
  The other thing I noticed was the absence of roads. There wasonly pavement,
  like the whole place was pedestrianised. (Years later,when returning to
  Bournemouth physically, I discovered that theseparts of Boscombe had indeed
  become pedestrianised. The overallappeal was much nicer as a result.) The
  houses lining the road weremuch wealthier and in a much better condition, and
  there were manymore shops than I had at first thought, although they were not
  packedtogether quite as closely as on the physical plane. Most of the
  displaysin the windows showed beautiful pieces of art and creation, but
  therewere also kitsch oddities that reassuringly broke with high standards
  ofgood taste. It made the place even more appealing that there was anoverall
  tolerance towards mixtures of styles, self expression andstandards of quality.
</p>
<p>
  However, there was something about this place, despite the goodtime I was
  having, which was rather at odds with how I felt. Then Irealised what it was:
  I did_not belong here. I was a tourist only, apassing visitor and I was
  yearning to move on. I looked into the deepsky and found it studded with
  bright and beautiful stars.
</p>
<p>
  As I gazed up I felt myself lifting off the ground and drifting intothe air,
  forlorn in my own thoughts and with a strong desire to be takenby a superior
  force into a higher realm.
</p>
<p>
  Despite all the wealth of pleasures and amusement to be hehere, the
  limitations of this world became suddenly very apparen‘There was an absence of
  any spirituality, which made me feel like astranger. This was a basic world
  with rather crude emotions. Sadly, no
</p>
<p>
  higher force took me into another, more refined, more beautiful, morespiritual
  realm than this one. I descended slowly to the road andwalked along the
  street, deep in thought and enveloped in slightmelancholy.
</p>
<p>
  Thad grown accustomed to the environment. As I walked along Ibecame aware of a
  middle-aged couple coming towards me. They weredifferent from the other
  inhabitants and I recognised them immediatelyas dreamers, holidaymakers in the
  truest sense, studying theisurroundings interestedly. I drifted close by them.
</p>
<p>
  Curiously enough, I bumped into my wife Julia, but she alwaysdrifted away
  until I found her again standing in front of the ChurchHall, staring at a
  bubble-shaped object fifteen feet in diametre. It wasmade almost entirely of
  glass. Inside was a comfortable chair with aman resting on it. As we
  approached he got up and left the bubble. Ithen knew that he was not the
  owner.
</p>
<p>
  I stuck my head inside through the round opening hatch andmarveled at its
  simple construction. The seat was moulded into thebubble, blending seamlessly
  with it. With a slight amusement, Ithought it looked like a design project an
  art student may have handedin at his college final year show, hoping to pick
  up an award or a gooddesign job with a future employer. No consideration was
  given tofunctionality and I thought it was a typical case of design over
  function.Then with a jolt I remembered that it was mine! It was my creation,
  andI remembered that in my waking life I often wondered what it wouldbe like
  to explore the universe inside the most simple spacecraft, beingpowered by
  nothing other than thought. Now I knew why the man leftwhen he saw me.
</p>
<p>
  Julia jumped inside with me. I could not spot any technicaldevices or
  instruments whatsoever, although it was quite clear to methat this was a craft
  of some kind, I employed the thought of upwardmovement and we shot straight up
  into the night sky.
</p>
<p>
  We went on a long excursion, visiting numerous planets - but thatis the only
  thing I remember, apart from the fact that at the time Ithought it would be
  impossible, far too incredible to even record afraction of the events. Hence,
  on my return, almost everything of this
</p>
<p>amazing journey was blotted out.</p>
<p>
  Many years later, when I was earning my living as a 3-D artist, Ioften
  wondered whether some of these scenes may have filtered backfrom a distant
  unconscious memory onto my digital canvas.
</p>
<p>
  Of all the realisations one can have in a lifetime, there can not beanything
  more exciting than finding yourself transported into a new universewhere the
  laws of nature you are accustomed to simply do not apply. Therealisation of
  such freedom - to go wherever you wish, to do whatever youwant - has no
  parallel in this physical world. If in 1976 I was offered thechoice between
  having all the money in the world to buy any luxury Iwished for, or,
  alternatively, being able to enter the gates of another universeat night, I
  would most certainly have picked the second option. Visiting otherworlds,
  which I speculated might one day be our permanent abode, wherewe commuted to
  and fro with unrestricted freedom, was a prospect tooincredible not to wish
  for.
</p>
<p>
  I wondered whether people would still exert the tremendous effort ofwork and
  sacrifice to acquire worldly goods, committing crimes if necessary,if they
  realised that all they had to do was to bide their time, lead a decentlife,
  spiritualise their consciousness so that it would vibrate on a moreexalted
  level, and simply wait for the gates of death to open for them and seetheir
  wildest dreams come true.
</p>
<p>
  1 also realised that all our ambitions and motivations, our dreams
  andyearning, might be based on distant memories of the dimensions beyond,which
  had found their way into mythology and fantasy fiction.
</p>
<p>
  Yet in 1976 I was only experiencing the humble beginnings of my
  greatadventure. The more I thought about it, the more obsessed I became.
</p>
<p>
  Little by little, with every experience in ever higher dimensions, thething
  that I began to appreciate most of all was that dreams and the nextdimensions
  are closely related. In the same way that we might sit in the
  officedaydreaming or fantasising about our holiday or the life we wish to
  lead, wecan experience those fantasies on the next dimension. We refer to
  these asdreams, because we lack waking awareness.
</p>
<p>
  A little bit of training could change all this. Awareness in the dreamstate
  really is something of extraordinary potential.
</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>°The intermediate dimensions:</p>
<p>Living the dream</p>
<p>
  As mentioned my visiting other dimensions did not happen in any kind oforder.
  From one experience to the next I found myself soaring in blissfulrealms to
  trudging through sludge on the lower levels. The reason for this isthat I was
  dealing with states of consciousness, not a chronological evolution.However,
  people dwelling on the higher levels will have evolvedenough to have attuned
  themselves to a much more positive state of mindand hence will be able to
  enjoy the creative power and fluid subtlety of thematter around them. One
  could draw a parallel to the psychology of humannature to get an idea of what
  the psychological equipment would have to belike for a person to find entry
  into these much more enjoyable realms. Thequalities needed are in tune with
  the essential nature of creation. In moralterms, they would be altruistic,
  with the realisation that there is no realdistinction between different energy
  forms whether they are man, animal, orany other form of consciousness. There
  is an intuitive realisation thateverything is derived from the same source and
  united by the same source.Friendships are strong and very rewarding on the
  higher dimensionsbecause everyone is a kindred spirit. The only selfish
  interest at work is thatfor self-development and the fulfillment of long
  cherished dreams, which inany case are not pursued at the cost of others.
  Quite the opposite, they areencouraged and pursued to the delight of others.
  Individuals living herehave developed an interest in the greater good of all
  life. The inhabitants arepositive, happy, cheerful and generally nurturing of
  a sense of humor; theyare creative, expansive, generous, tolerant, kind, and
  all the other positive
</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>
  Locharacteristics that form the basis of an enjoyable life in a very
  agreeableenvironment.
</p>
<p>
  Because they have harmonised their psychological makeup they are in aconstant
  state of creativeness with the fabric and matter around them. Theirlife is one
  big holiday. Their body finds a vibrant youthfulness, which even attheir peak
  they wouldn't have experienced on Earth. Where on Earth theymay have yearned
  for a makeover to banish physical defects, body-weight orthe signs of aging,
  here they find that their physical appearance is in directProportion to the
  attractiveness of their expanding awareness.
</p>
<p>
  All people here are attractive, their individualities unfolded. Here itbecomes
  fully apparent what a beautiful species we are. The attractiveness ofmen and
  women is expressed in millions of different nuances of beauty. Theharmony and
  beauty of their personalities is expressed on their features. Theones I met
  were always very friendly and positive. The great diversity ofmankind finds
  its greatest expression on the higher levels. Vast regions areallocated to
  individuals with similar interests and with unlimited ways ofexpressing them.
</p>
<p>
  It is perhaps useful to consider how dreams manifest on these lewhat laws
  govern them.
</p>
<p>
  1 would like to illustrate it with an example of a person who alwayswished on
  Earth to own a powerful Lamborgini supercar, Now, on a higherdimension, he is
  realising his dream to the minutest detail. How does asupercar like this come
  into existence? Does it show every individualfunctioning part of the engine or
  is it just imagined, like a shell with noengine and driven by thought power,
  because the driver is not a mechanicand can’t imagine it? Surprisingly, the
  supercar is in every respect a complereplica of its Earth counterpart. The
  reason for this is that the creative foron the higher_dimensions are drawn
  from the universal matrix, wtcontains the energy pattern of everything that is
  already in existence on aplane of the universe, whether it is just thought of
  or a physical reality. Thtmoment a person's energy is aligned to the
  environment, their wishes or‘expectations call upon the matrix, which
  materializes the supercar in front ofhis eyes. The same is true for all the
  luxury items we crave for in Earth life,but cannot have because of financial
  limitations. But the things we manifeston the higher levels are the real
  thing.
</p>
<p>However, this is not always the case on the lower levels, because it is</p>
<p>
  entirely dependent on the quality of our energy and our alignment with the
</p>
<p>ls,</p>
<p>
  matrix. The materialization may fail, or produce poor results (as in the case
  ofmy wine experiment), so the person will have to work to synchronize
  theircharacter to have their wishes granted. This in turn shows that the laws
  ofevolution work throughout all dimensions.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to this, each creative thought or desire extends to the matrix.We
  will find that movies made on Earth are a physical reality on other
  planesbecause tens of thousands of people have been watching them and
  addingtheir passion and joy - both powerful instruments for manifestation.
  Theenvironments may fade over time, but are re-established quickly when
  newattention is directed towards them. The same applies to books of
  fiction,where the combined forces of imagination create a vast and open
  matrix,which responds to anyone showing an interest by supplying a
  materialreality.
</p>
<p>
  I shall leave it to the imagination of the reader to ponder the
  infinitePossibilities of worlds such as these. Anything that can be imagined
  is areality here. It is easy to understand the temptation of people wanting
  tospend centuries in this world in order to explore its infinite
  possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  ‘One question which puzzled me for a long time was whether therewere worlds
  uninhabited by intelligent life in the next dimension, just as theyare in our
  physical universe. I believe I found the answer in the experiencesreported in
  the next journal entry.
</p>
<p>
  I noticed over the years that everything in the physical dimension has
  asuper-dimensional counterpart by way of the fact that on a higher
  dimensionthe complexity and abundance of creation becomes more profound. It
  seemsthere is a trickle-down effect. For example, the combined essential power
  ofmillions of species of dandelion focuses its energy to produce a single
  specieson Planet Earth. I can sense immediately a reaction of ‘what nonsense’,
  asobviously dandelions have evolved and specialised over millennia, and yet
  Icannot help but see that there is a sustaining essence at work, operating on
  ahigher dimension.
</p>
<p>
  T have the feeling that sooner or later science will have to accept
  thateverything on this physical world is subject to the laws of a
  super-dimension.Once this is fully understood, man’s scientific progress will
  explode into life.With quantum physics and the innovations it has brought
  about - like super-conductivity - we are edging closer and closer to other
  dimensions. Soon the
</p>
<p>
  boundaries will blur and then, possibly, we will be able to leap into the
  nextuniverse.
</p>
<p>
  To me it is inconceivable that this physical universe stands on its
  own,brought about by a big bang coming from nowhere. Very soon scientists
  willlook upon this outdated hypothesis with embarrassment. Research willprove
  that a super-universe, with many others above it, is essential to explainour
  existence. The out-of-body traveller will take a bolder step and state thatthe
  super-tniverses are many times more abundant and complex than thistrickle-down
  universe we inhabit.
</p>
<p>
  The mind boggles when it tries to understand the astonishing expanseof this
  physical universe alone. We only have to pick out a tiny speck of lightin the
  night sky and realise that this speck is a cluster of hundreds ofgalaxies,
  each containing billions of stars and possibly millions of planetsable to
  sustain physical life forms, and our mind starts freaking out. Nowimagine this
  is just a trickle-down version of events in the next dimension. IfWwe marvel
  at the power of creation just in our physical universe...well, justimagine.

  Settlers on another planet21st November 2007Early morning. I got up to
  meditate, still a little tired. After doing my
</p>
<p>
  ~ breathing exercise I went into deep meditation, but I was having a hardtime
  concentrating. Instead of focusing easily on the mantra, I becamedrowsy and
  found myself involved in a battle against sleep. I couldhave left it there and
  then, gone back to bed and just slept, but I didn’t.Something inside me wanted
  to prove that I could conquer sleep.Heavy visions drifted past me over which I
  had almost no control. I just— had to tear myself away from them and return to
  the mantra.
</p>
<p>
  It was as if | was walking through treacle. There was a heavinesscouldn't
  fight any longer and soon dreams carried me off into anotherworld,
</p>
<p>
  At first I didn’t even realise that I was dreaming. We had landed‘on another
  planet and enjoyed frolicking around along the beach,enjoying ourselves
  splashing in the water and chasing large fish. I saywe, because I was in a
  group of about five people, all of whomappeared to be friends and yet none
  whom I remembered from Earth.
</p>
<p>
  We we were bound together, having appeared here as a group so tospeak. A large
  spaceship was perched precariously on a huge gherkin-like rock poking out a
  few hundred feet high from the water. I can’tremember whether it was us who
  had parked it there or whether it hadbeen there all along,
</p>
<p>
  I only knew that I was dreaming when I started chasing aftersome sea lions
  under water and realised that I could breathe.Immediately, I started seeing
  things differently. I pointed it out to myfellow companions they looked at me
  as if I was mad.
</p>
<p>“Of course this is not a dream,” they seemed to say. “What is the</p>
<p>I matter with you?”</p>
<p>
  Tlooked at the large spaceship sitting on the rock high above us.The rock,
  overgrown by green vegetation, was truly from anotherworld. Whether it was the
  nature of the stone, which was totallyunfamiliar, or its weird shape that was
  telling me we were on adifferent planet I was unable to tell, but somehow I
  knew. There weredozens of fantastically beautiful monster rocks like this
  strewn acrossthe water like islands. Some of them had large caves carved in
  theirbases and I wondered what power was at work that kept them upright.On
  Earth they would have long succumbed to gravity.
</p>
<p>
  I wondered how we had got here and I had a vague recollectionof having
  travelled through space, remembering passing a strangeplanet, but that was
  when I was still dreaming and I couldn’t be sure.What I was sure of was that
  this was not some parallel dimension ofEarth, but a different planet
  altogether, far from the exalted parallelcounterparts I had always been able
  to associate with Earth. This wasdifferent. It felt strange and_alien,
  a_non-consensus_environment,something created in some other part of the
  universe by the same forcesthat had created the rest of the physical and non
  physical universes.
</p>
<p>
  The light was different too. Not unpleasant, it had a rather pinky‘warm glow.
  Looking at the horizon I saw a vast mountain range muchtaller than one would
  normally expect. I remembered on Earth lookingout over the sea at a cloud-line
  over the distant horizon and imaginingthey were large mountains. By judging
  the aspect ratio of distance andheight of the mountains, I thought they would
  have to be tens of miles
</p>
<p>high.</p>
<p>
  It was only when two of my friends suggested we split our groupinto two that
  the immensity of this experience dawned upon me.
</p>
<p>
  Here I was, fully awake - no, not fully awake, super-awake - witha clarity of
  consciousness and a sharpness to my visual and auditory‘senses I hadn’t
  experienced on Earth for a long time. This alone thrilledme immensely - it
  filled me with_utter joy, I knew I had to beiplined and be mindful that strong
  emotion would cut theexperience short and make me wake up in my chair,
  probably slumpedover, not meditating at all. But this was just so exciting,
  Not only theclarity of my consciousness, but also the fact that I had
  probablytravelled countless light years into another part of the universe was
  toostaggering and too astonishing not to get excited about.
</p>
<p>
  My friends appeared to be much more matter-of-fact about thisnovel condition
  and calmly discussed who should explore what andwho should go with whom, It
  was this calm rationality which kept merooted in this alternate universe;
  their sober example was just what Ineeded.
</p>
<p>
  Three of the group made for the large mountain range, while twoof us, a young
  lady and myself, stayed behind to explore thesurroundings closer at hand.
</p>
<p>
  I expressed concern that we might lose each other on this vastplanet if we
  split up. It was not something anybody else seemed toworry about.
</p>
<p>
  A short distance along the seafront, we came upon a small town.It was built
  mainly in a neoclassic style. Everything about it oozedwealth and prosperity.
  There were people milling about in fashions thwouldn’t have looked out of
  place in 20s or 30s Earth. Gentle folk wenabout in chauffeur-driven
  Rolls-Royce style cars. It was like going backin time.
</p>
<p>
  We passed a 1920s Bentley - black, as one would expect. I gotclose enough to
  admire the chrome trimming. It was incredible. It wasjust as I would have
  expected it to look if I went into a car museum onEarth and looked at a fully
  restored car. I brushed my hand over thepaintwork and inspected it closely.
  There were even micro scratcheslike I observed when polishing my own car. This
  was almost moreastonishing than the whole scene surrounding us. How could
  theminds that created this car give it such astonishing attention to detail?
</p>
<p>
  Or could it have been me, whose expectation had added the detail as Ilooked?
</p>
<p>
  I started talking to a couple who were taking a stroll on the seapromenade,
  and asked them who was in charge of this place. Theypointed at a large mansion
  surrounded by a park in the distance.
</p>
<p>
  As we approached the front door of the mansion, two servantsopened the doors
  and the owner, a true old-fashioned Englishgentleman, welcomed us inside.
</p>
<p>“We've been expecting you,” he said, to my surprise.</p>
<p>
  After my probing he explained to me that they had all been livinghere on this
  planet for some seventy or eighty years. It was part of anexperiment.
</p>
<p>
  When they died, a group of them got together and weretransported onto this
  strange new world to establish a colony, or acommunity, from scratch. Given
  the dimension they were in, this wasnot as hard a challenge as the first
  Western settlers in America orAustralia faced. With their combined effort they
  soon created a veryacceptable home with all the luxuries the privileged gentry
  of theirtime could afford.
</p>
<p>
  They even had servants. I wondered what kind of people wouldvolunteer as
  servants in a world which would allow them, by the merepower of their intent,
  to live the life of the ruling class. The owner ofthe mansion explained to me
  that the servants, and all the animals aswell, were artificial entities,
  established gradually as self-containedentities by the consistent will of
  their owners and which would, to acertain degree, even develop personalities.
  They were astonishinglyconvincing - they had certainly fooled me into thinking
  that they werereal.
</p>
<p>
  My host showed me around the grounds. Outside was a hugepark with stables,
  tennis courts and a golf course. The architecture wasamazing: something on
  this scale would easily have fetched a fewmillion pounds back on Earth,
</p>
<p>
  He explained they had an agreeable life and that the communityof some forty or
  fifty original settlers lived here happily. They spentmost of their time
  developing their home towns and grounds and‘expanding their luxurious
  lifestyle. The creation of artificial entities likeservants and staff was an
  integral part of it.
</p>
<p>
  He explained that everybody felt that after so many years theexperiment had
  now come to its natural end and that people had beganto tire of their lives
  here. He told me that he was glad that we had cometo collect them. He said
  that he and his wife would be keen to gather afew mementoes to take with them.
</p>
<p>
  My friend, who had been with me until just now, was chatting toanother
  gentleman and when I joined them we were shown a secretdoor he had kept (or
  had been trying to keep) secret from the othersduring all these years, but he
  wasn’t one hundred percent sure that hehad succeeded.
</p>
<p>
  The door led to a downstairs to a different world altogether. Itwas like
  Aladdin's cave. As we were going down the stairs, a largeunderground palace
  opened up before us, which was straight out ofOne Thousand and One Nights.
  Everything was in the classical MiddleEastern style, displaying the opulent
  wealth of some sultan, which canbe seen only in fairy tales. To my
  astonishment we saw a number ofscantily dressed women bowing in front of us
  and flocking aroundtheir master.
</p>
<p>
  He told us without any flicker of embarrassment whatsoever thatthis was his
  secret lust palace. He had kept it secret because it was theonly way he could
  indulge in his wildest fantasies, which would notnecessarily find approval
  with the other settlers. Also, he said, it wasimportant to him to havea
  private life.
</p>
<p>
  He had worked for many years to create this luxuriousunderground kingdom. I
  was astonished by the number of beautiful,sexy maidens and began to wonder
  what it was that had attracted therrto become his slaves. He read my thoughts
  and, with a smile, heexplained that all cial entities and not realhumans. They
  were of his own creation, imagined to perfection, refinedand beautified by
  loving thought. They were ensouled by his love andaffection and their
  attractiveness were proof of this. These were hisdreams manifested.
</p>
<p>
  I was shocked and fascinated in equal measure. They were almosttoo real to be
  just a fantasy. I was aware of one young, ratherstereotypical girl with jet
  black hair, fiery emerald eyes and poutingdeep red lips who appeared to be
  rather sullen. Reading my thoughts,the man confessed that she was jealous of
  the other girls and that he
</p>
<p>mistresses were a</p>
<p>
  found it difficult to control her. He didn’t know how to deal with
  herjealousy. All he could do was give her lots of attention.
</p>
<p>
  I asked what would happen to them when he left. He said thatunder normal
  circumstances artificial entities, like everything else thatwas no longer
  being sustained by the attention of the settlers, wouldfade away gradually.
  But he wasn’t so sure that this would apply in hiscase. It would be more
  likely that they would accompany himwherever he went, because he couldn't
  think of any way of shakinghimself loose from them. In the countless years he
  had spent withthem, they had grown so strong that they were almost persons in
  theirown right.
</p>
<p>
  Looking at two beauties with long blond hair standing next tohim and gently
  caressing his chest, I wondered why anyone wouldwant to dispense with such
  attractive companions, but then a part fromGoethe's poem The Sorcerer's
  Apprentice sprang to my mind, which said,roughly translated: “Now the spirits,
  which I had called upon, I could Jnot banish anymore.” 4
</p>
<p>
  “I guess they will be with me for a while,” he said, which wasconfirmed
  eagerly by the young ladies’ broad, almost triumphantsmiles.
</p>
<p>
  Back in the mansion the owners had assembled a hoard of theirthings, which
  they said had sentimental value. I noticed there appearedto be beautifully
  crafted artifacts among the other things, and of thesethe one that caught my
  eye was a plaque fashioned in an unknownmetal, which I was told proudly was
  the title to the Lordship of thesettlement.
</p>
<p>Outside the building I saw other residents gathering theirbelongings.</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, here the story ends. I woke up when Julia ofteredme a cup of
  tea, but it wasn’t a dream I had woken from.
</p>
<p>
  This was one of the more profound and intense experiences I had hadfor a very
  long time. It was all the more profound as it threw up a greatnumber of
  questions, and for days I delved into deep meditation, ponderingthe nature of
  the world I had encountered.
</p>
<p>
  Thinking about the man with his private harem it became clear to me,that the
  next world is a place where all kinds of fantasies must be fulfilled, no
</p>
<p>
  matter how bizarre. That is the very nature of these dimensions. We caneasily
  imagine that this will apply to even the most corrupt and criminalfantasies,
  which undoubtedly will take place on far lower dimensions. Onemay shudder
  about the scope of this. Fortunately I was spared witnessingthese nightmare
  regions and any person of reasonable integrity will nevercome across them.
  Here in everyday life, whatever our fantasies, we readilyaccept that our
  nightly dreams fulfill a similar function. However, in the nextdimension,
  fantasies become “physical” realities, no matter how wild. In asense they are
  still fantasies and in the case of the young man with his haremno real people
  needed to be involved or exploited at all. No matter how wejudge the actions
  of our fellow humans, we must face the reality, that as aspecies we are
  programmed to gather experience no matter how extreme.
</p>
<p>
  When reflecting on the event in deep meditation, it was made clear tome that
  the settlers of this story had died in the 1920s. At a party or gatheringthe
  group had mixed with some enthusiastic astronomers who had built aspaceship to
  venture into the higher dimensional counterparts of deep space.They could
  simply have dispensed with the spaceship and used their bodiesto glide
  bird-like through outer space, visiting other worlds and planets, butthe idea
  of the spaceship had come about because they wanted a more socialenvironment.
  So they assembled this ship and went on an adventurousexcursion though space.
</p>
<p>
  Thad the immediate impression that the space they had visited was onan even
  grander and more magnificent scale than in the physical universe,which in
  itself is impossible to imagine. And if we are staggered by lookingat images
  taken with giant space telescopes, then it is even more staggeringto imagine a
  universe not only much vaster, but richer in its creation.
</p>
<p>
  In my inner vision I saw the party evolve into a lively discussion anthe
  decision that the group should start a settlement on another planet faway from
  the place they were accustomed to.
</p>
<p>
  After they had discovered the planet with the counsel of theirastronomer
  friends, they established a colony. Their astronomer friendssimply projected
  back to were they had come from, leaving the ship behindto remind them of
  their history. Any one of the settlers could have left at anytime, but it had
  become part of their folk history that they had travelled greatdistances and
  that they were dependent on astronautical help to be escortedback to their
  original home. What really happened, I believe, was therealisation that it was
  time to move on.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that struck me as curious was the very mundane,
  Earth-likephysicality of their creations - for instance, the car and its
  incredible level ofdetail, like the minor dents in the chrome and the micro
  scratches on thePaintwork, which can only be appreciated close up.
</p>
<p>
  Tthen thought about the phenomena which physicists on Earth describeas ‘the
  observer effect’, whereby sub-atomic particles change their behaviourin
  accordance with merely being observed. It seems that physicists really
  arescratching at the door to the next dimension. I have found ths it mutter,
  oncein the next dimension, is easily manipulated by thought; in fact, the
  mainPastime of our dead relatives appears to be the pursuit of creation, and
  theease with which this can be accomplished makes it a very attractive
  hobbyindeed.
</p>
<p>
  It is so easy in fact, that our subconsciousness takes an active andVigorous
  part in jt, This would explain the appearance of the micro scratchesin the
  paintwork when I looked at the bonnet of the Bentley close up, as wellas the
  miniscule blemishes in the chrome. It is what I would have expected,and what
  might have been assembled instantly from the universal matrixwhen I focussed
  my attention on the cat. This also throws new light on ourdreams, which can be
  the most realistic creations when we live them out.
</p>
<p>
  Life in the next dimension is indeed a magical experience. There areworlds
  that have been created by disciplined minds, adhering to conventionand
  interested only in replicating the world that they had grown to lovewhen on
  Earth, but there are other worlds, more adventurous, more bold indesign and
  creative in fantasy, which are there to be explored by travelersalso more
  adventurous, bold and creative.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe there is an element of insanity in the next world on from thephysical,
  which makes people wish to hold on to solid and proven virtuesand values.
  Being an artist I can see myself anticipating with eagerness theSreatest
  adventure man is likely to encounter after his death.
</p>
<p>
  The novel experience of meeting artificial entities was a great eye-Opener to
  me. When investigating the phenomena further during meditationT found that the
  creation of artificial entities is more widespread than I hadanticipated.
  After all, there may be many men here on Earth who would lovethe opportunity
  to emulate the life of the settler with his own personalharem. There are
  stories since antiquity, like the ancient sculptor Pygmalionwho loved the
  stature he created so much that she came to life. The nextworld appears to be
  a place where our dreams come true. Whether they turn
</p>
<p>
  out good or bad is just another experience to help us forward in ourevolution
  as sentient beings.
</p>
<p>Physical work in an nonphysical world22nd October 1977,</p>
<p>
  After meditating for forty five minutes, I entered a deep trance withemerging
  images beckoning me to succumb to a dream. A heavybuzzing sound put me on
  conscious alert and with great clarity I tookcontrol of the situation. I found
  myself immediately fully awake in the
</p>
<p>
  = next dimension - a counterpart of Watford, where we lived at that
  time.Curiously, the surroundings kept changing as if they couldn't make
  uptheir minds about whether they were a dream or a reality. Julia poppedinto
  the scene and disappeared again like some other-worldlyphantom. I concluded
  that she was a figment of my imagination, anartificial entity that I had
  created out of unsolved conflicts and a desireto be close. As I observed her
  phantom, her features began to morphand with a jolt I realised I was looking
  at myself as if in a mirror. Theshock catapulted me back into my body.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to discontinue with my meditation and to go back tobed to get more
  sleep. Almost as soon as I drifted off I found myselfsitting in full waking
  consciousness on the steps of a tall building.Young people poured out,
  seemingly oblivious of my presence. Iconcluded it was outside the main door of
  a college. I had toconcentrate to keep my awareness and I stared at the pores
  of the stonyin front of me until I had clarity.
</p>
<p>
  The scenery didn’t change at first, but when my attention becaeven more
  focused, I saw soft mists of colour drifting before me. Tt |were as sweet as
  perfume. Through the mists a wide open countrysicemerged, covered with nuances
  of emerald greens. I stared mesmerisedat black rocks near to where I sat,
  arranged in a mysterious geometricpattern. Whether they were man-made or the
  creation of some celestialcreatures I could not tell. They stretched out
  further and further inincreasing variations until stopping at the shores of a
  calm and peacefullake. This was a place so serene that it invited
  contemplation. Smooth,gentle waves rippled ashore, braking with musical sounds
  rather thanthe white noise of physical waves.
</p>
<p>10. am</p>
<p>
  I don’t remember getting up, yet suddenly I found myselfstanding at the
  water’s edge. Looking around I discovered the wholelake was framed by rising
  and falling hills, like a grassy equivalent ofthe lake's swells. It was only
  natural to rise eagle-like into the air. This‘was my natural element. Carried
  on the wind of sweet feelings I driftedwithout thought over sheer endless
  terrain.
</p>
<p>
  On the verge of being lullabied into a blissful dream, Iremembered where I was
  and that it was time to stop indulging andstart doing some proper work.
</p>
<p>
  I descended to the ground, gently trying not to break the fragileblades of
  grass under my feet. I needed to know, for no other reasonthan to satisfy my
  desire for facts, what the nature of this world trulywas. Was it made from
  dreams, human imagination or was it formed =|
</p>
<p>
  a similar fashion to land on Planet Earth, by the almighty powers ofphysics?
  Where was I?
</p>
<p>
  A good starting point was to take to the air again. To my greatsurprise, I
  came to rest only moments later on a rubbish dump. At least,that's what I
  thought it was.
</p>
<p>
  I wondered whether my contrived and very worldly thirst forfacts had corrupted
  my state of mind and lowered me to a much morebasic dimension than the
  heavenly scene I had so much enjoyedmoments earlier. But the rubbish dump
  turned out to be made fromprecious metals: silver and gold flashed all around
  me. Not far from theheaps I saw buildings like factories. At least a dozen
  people wereworking on the site, carrying metals and loading and
  unloadingstrange wagons.
</p>
<p>
  1 approached a worker. He appeared to have Down’s Syndrome.Having worked as a
  therapist with the mentally disabled at that time, Iconsidered the possibility
  that these people may be dreamers, making =up for their lack of physical
  activity on the Earth plane bycompensating here in their dreams with this
  physical labour.
</p>
<p>
  I asked the man whether I could have a chat with somebody incharge. He pointed
  towards a man floating across the site in anarmchair, The moment I spotted him
  he came towards me. I couldn’tsuppress a smirk: he operated his armchair like
  a one-man helicopter. Ithink I offended him with the thought, because he
  changed course and
</p>
<p>
  disappeared with his chair into a small hut perched on tall stilts,overlooking
  the site.
</p>
<p>
  I tried to strike up a conversation with another worker, but he‘was too busy,
  and I thought he was almost angry with me fordisrupting his work. Obviously
  there was no room for me here and Idecided to return to where I had come from.
  The experience had left mefeeling rejected and depleted.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Taking to the air again, I had difficulty controlling my flyingmovement and I
  lost altitude almost as quickly as I had risen up, whichI tried to regain
  vainly with ineffective swimming movements.Movement and flight in this
  dimension is definitely affected by feeling,I thought. The expression ‘as high
  as a kite’ now made sense to me.
</p>
<p>
  But maybe it was my lack of focus and an incoherent mind thatcaused my
  difficulties. I thought about the man in his flying armchair,and assuming a
  sitting position in mid-air, I pretended to operate aninvisible helicopter, I
  succeeded magnificently. When I pushed animaginary lever control backwards, I
  moved forward, when I pusheddown it went up, and visa versa.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, several hundred feet above the ground, I spotted a roadsnaking across
  the land below me, a wide thoroughfare or a broadhighway lined with trees,
  which led towards a town in the distance.People coming towards me passed under
  me without paying me anyattention, I changed direction, crisscrossing the
  country like someaimless flying tourist.
</p>
<p>
  After a short time I began to tire of my maneuvers. I thought itwas a
  pointless waste of time. Having started the day with meditation,I felt that
  this was not the most worthwhile thing to do.
</p>
<p>
  I settled down on the grass. Closing my eyes, I took a long breathfrom the
  depth of my stomach and raised it up through my body, andchanted my mantra,.
  The effect was instantaneous and dramatic. Mybody was catapulted into the air
  on the current I had created, up to adizzying height. Each breath and every
  chant increased the sensationand I was flooded with bliss and overwhelmed by
  warmth. Whenbreathing out and relaxing, I surrendered like a feather to a
  currentwhich can only be described as love. I could have been a fish
  beingcarried blissfully by the stream, or a bird carried by the wind.
</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man.</p>
<p>
  Another deep breath and a chant unfolded the universe in aeof me. A vast space
  opened up, a giant symmetrical web made fromgolden threads, each junction
  studded with an enormous golden sunEach sun casting off golden patterns, which
  interacted with each 0 bees
</p>
<p>
  The length of time between breaths seemed unnatural as I drif oethrough
  indescribable feelings. Another breath. The space deepentfurther still until
  it revealed an infinite glorious blue space. The onlywords which came to mind
  were passion, devotion and love, and yetthey sounded almost insultingly
  inadequate to describe what I sa’here,
</p>
<p>
  Words are strange things. They can conjure images based only onexperience of
  the speaker. One day, when we as a species venture band aesthe higher
  dimension, only a smile and a wink will be needecommunicate our experiences.
  Until then, words are allwehave, =
</p>
<p>
  My body appeared fast asleep when my attention returned to it, Z >half
  meditating. I gathered the recent events and willed them to be store
  ifmemories in my physical brain. This was the only way to bridge the 6.between
  the two dimensions - otherwise my mind would have been wipclean of the
  experience. sis HE wed
</p>
<p>
  After this there was a long break in my out-of-body excursions. 1 Waalmost as
  if I had spent all the heavenly experiences allotted to me. It iistime for a
  break. still spent many hours in meditation, starting at five orin the
  morning, and late at night before retiring to bed. :
</p>
<p>
  Thad lucid dreams, but not worth recording, Lonly entered their datesinto my
  diaries, but no other details.
</p>
<p>Sight-seeing tour of a big city3rd January 2007</p>
<p>
  When I became lucid in my dream I was standing in a room _several people, all
  of whom I seemed to know, but not from my worldlyencounters. There were two
  women and two men. We were all aboutthe same age, and a lot younger than I was
  at the time on the physic 4plane. I would say we were in our late twenties or
  early thirties. One o}the men was a rather authoritative figure, but very
  friendly. Hesuggested we go outside and have a sight-seeing tour of the town.
</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>
  aOur little group stepped outside the building and onto a largesquare. I
  couldn't believe my eyes. The town was magnificent. All thebuildings were of a
  Baroque architecture, but to call it simply Baroquewould do the magnificence
  of the buildings a great discredit. However,the first thing I noticed about
  the buildings was the sheer scale of them.They were edifices, each one a
  monument to the architect whoconceived it. The details were phenomenal and
  very elaborate, so muchso that I could quite easily have stood in front of any
  of these structuresfor many hours to absorb their intricacy and artistic
  accomplishment,their inherent harmony and expression of character. It is
  impossible tobegin to describe them.
</p>
<p>
  The material used for their construction added an additionaldimension to their
  appeal. The builders had used translucent stones,mixed tastefully with more
  ‘traditional’ stones for contrast. While thestyle of the town was broadly
  Baroque, each one was unique, whichmade it impossible to decide where to begin
  to look.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The town, although large by Earth standards, was not very busyat all. Only a
  few visitors, no more than curious tourists with no otherpurpose than to
  satisfy their visual desires, were to be seen. It was likea huge
  non-functional city, its main purpose seemed to be to lookpretty.
</p>
<p>
  As so often in these dimensions, I was able to identify theapproximate
  location of this town simply by its atmosphere. Although Icould not identify
  any architectural features, I knew instinctively thatthis was a
  super-dimensional counterpart of the city of Hamburg. Onefeature of the
  earthly Hamburg was apparent, however: the multitude
</p>
<p>
  — canals crisscrossing the city. Those by themselves had a great charm:they
  were Venice-like, but infinitely better since more thought had goneinto the
  design of the embankments, where people walked alonghappily and watched quaint
  boats going past.
</p>
<p>
  ‘When there is all the time in the world and an unlimited source ofenergy and
  power, then it is easy to understand why it is so easy tocteate cities of such
  artistic perfection that are possible to realise only inthe imagination on the
  physical level. There, the ‘physical’ reality isstaggering.
</p>
<p>
  Around each street corner we found a new, totally unexpectedpart of the town.
  On one occasion it was a fairly narrow lane leading
</p>
<p>
  into an open square. The houses were much smaller and of a Tudor-style design,
  except that they had taken Tudor to another level. Thedark wooden beams were
  carved very intricately, which would havetaken many years to accomplish on
  Earth. The whole atmosphere ofthis part of the town was designed solely to
  give visual pleasure. Andas if that wasn’t enough, our guide then took us out
  of the square to alow walled terrace overlooking a grand river. To my
  surprise, I noticedthat the scenery was covered in snow; a golden light from
  the sky madethe whole place glisten in rainbow colours. The snow looked
  sorandomly dispersed that I thought it would have been impossible togenerate
  the effect artificially.
</p>
<p>
  I bent down to take a closer look and found that the snow wasmade up of
  trillions of beautiful, intricate ice crystals, which again, 1thought would
  have been impossible to generate via humanimagination. I looked at out guide,
  who just smiled without divulgingan explanation.
</p>
<p>
  The golden light reflecting off the snow’s surface had astimulating effect on
  me, generating a deep pleasure. Neither the snownor the atmosphere was cold at
  all, but rather gentle and comforting. !remembered a feeling I had had as a
  child when I came in from playingin the snow and warmed my frozen hands on the
  stove, and theincredible pleasure this had generated: the feeling of being
  home, warmand secure. This is how I felt. I was at home, warm and secure
  andsurrounded by snow.
</p>
<p>
  Our little group wandered along the river bank and then the twoyoung women of
  our company split off and skipped along ahead of uslike children disappearing
  into a park. We came to a point where thebig sea-like river branched off into
  a smaller stream cascading down asmall waterfall about twenty feet high.
  Without warning, one of mycompanions jumped straight into the water fully
  clothed with acheerful shout.
</p>
<p>
  This was the first time I had looked at myself, and seeing myselfdressed in a
  beige suit with an open summer shirt, I wondered whetherI should take my
  clothes off and follow suit. Somehow this seemed tobe too much trouble, as I
  just jumped down the waterfall to meet mybeckoning friend and floated
  blissfully in the warm, happy currentwithout the discomfort of feeling wet.
  The floating feeling was
</p>
<p>
  enhanced by the childlike joy we felt, and before I knew it one of thewomen
  had jumped into the stream to join us. What followed wasalmost too corny to
  describe. One moment we were paddling andsplashing about, the next my friend
  was commandeering a big raft,which he navigated skillfully and powerfully
  across the river whilepulling stunts in the process, which caused much
  laughter.
</p>
<p>
  Without having to dry ourselves after getting out of the water wecontinued our
  walk alongside a park until we came to an open green.We entered a huge brick
  and glass tower - a very contemporary piece ofarchitecture, beautifully
  designed. Without quite knowing how, wefound ourselves in a corridor of the
  upper floor. At the end of thecorridor was a floor-to-ceiling vestibule
  overlooking a vast expanse oflandscape. When I entered the vestibule I was
  actually standing on aglass floor with a huge drop hundreds of metres below
  me. I wasshocked for a moment, and feared that I might fall through the
  fragilelooking glass. But it held very firm underfoot.
</p>
<p>
  —— Quite abruptly, I found myself awake in my bed, regretting thefact that I
  had had no opportunity to say goodbye to my friends.
</p>
<p>Marriages made in heaven18th November 2007</p>
<p>
  Partying seems to be a great way to spend time in the next dimension. On
  anumber of occasions I have stumbled into festivities and parties which
  wouldput the Rio Carnival to shame. And when you think that there are
  noconstraints on budget, time or venue, and no authorisation or licence
  isneeded, then it is easy to understand that the party of all parties is
  possible ina world limited only by the power of imagination.
</p>
<p>
  I could not help but be impressed by the inventiveness of theparticipants of
  these parties and the unlimited capacity for their enjoyment.After all, there
  was a lot to be joyful about. It isn’t hard to see the effect thatthe combined
  joy and exuberance of hundreds - maybe even thousands - ofparty goers has on
  the emotional experience. Even as an outsider I found it abreeze to blend in,
  and I was able to study the dynamics of theseextraordinary events without
  being overwhelmed by them, always consciousthat I was a visitor in another
  dimension.
</p>
<p>
  (On this occasion I was having a dream in which I was looking formy car, and
  irritated that I couldn’t recall where I had parked. While Iwas searching for
  it, I was distracted by the incredibly diverse andbeautiful town I was in, and
  on every street I turned into I found newand surprising architecture.
</p>
<p>
  Talso noticed there were no cars at all, and suddenly I becameaware that this
  was not a dream at all, but another location in acompletely different
  dimension.
</p>
<p>
  Now I could relax and enjoy the experience. The first comparisonwith an Earth
  town that sprang to mind was the seaside resort of PortMeiron on the Welsh
  coast, but this was far more wealthy inimaginative architectural detail, and,
  oddly, more quaint. There was s0much unusual design that it was impossible to
  focus on individualelements. Ironically, the word ‘dreamlike’ came to mind
  with a sense ofamusement, as indeed some of the architectural features
  appeared to beas if plucked from a dream. They had plenty of non-functional
  featuressuch as exaggerated patters, which appeared quite surreal. It
  isworthwhile remembering that on our physical planet, no matter howexotic the
  architecture or design, everything is geared towardsfunctionality, as it is
  dependent on gravity and limitations of material.On this dimension, however,
  there were no such restraints, and thearchitecture made only a token reference
  to the laws of physics in orderto accommodate our need for tradition and
  familiarity. The diversity,though, beggared belief, yet it all still managed
  to adhere to the sublimeJaws of symmetry and aesthetics. There was an absence
  of conformity,yet a real sense of harmony.
</p>
<p>
  And then there were the people. It is easy to imagine how theabsence of
  economical needs influences the dynamics of a culture; howthe unlimited power
  of self-expression and the thrill of being able tosocialise with like-minded
  yet extremely diverse sets of people cancreate a cultural strata, which could
  appear very alien to visitors fromthis world. Liberty and tolerance were
  another distinguishing feature ofthe population: many people were unafraid to
  parade their sexualattractiveness in the most scantily dressed way possible’
  SSS
</p>
<p>
  ‘We have to remember that the populations of places like this aremade up of
  people like us but who are liberated from the restrictions ofeconomic strife
  and are free to explore their deepest desires, while at
</p>
<p>
  the same time being naturally attracted to a large yet diverse number
  ofkindred spirits. Many of us would regard such social reality as
  heavenitself.
</p>
<p>
  The town was crowded with people, many of whom woreexquisite costumes. My
  impression was that it was like a tourist resort,where people had taken a
  break from their work and were indulging inidle activities, with the sole
  purpose of enjoying themselves and givingpleasure to others.
</p>
<p>
  When I left the town and came to the beach I noticed by theattitude of
  expectation that a show was about to start. A number ofpeople were staring out
  to sea, and I knew that the show was going to‘be what can only be described as
  a ‘weather show’. Soon the sky overthe sea darkened to deep blues and purples
  under rolling, menacingclouds. The excitement was electrifying. Suddenly the
  clouds burstasunder and bolts of lightning shot down into the mountainous
  oceanwaves, which reared hundreds of feet into the air like giant
  tsunamisstopping just short of crashing ashore. As the skies split open
  again,shafts of golden light hit the ocean crests and made them sparkle
  likegiant diamonds.
</p>
<p>
  The show went on for some time, never stalling for lack ofvariety. I never
  knew who the artist was, but it was the most impressivedisplay of unnatural
  weather phenomena I had ever seen.
</p>
<p>
  When the sky reverted back to its customary summer blue,turned back towards
  the town.
</p>
<p>
  I was attracted to a street by a powerful rendition of Mozart’sFigaro, and
  then I saw a procession of people dressed in the mostexuberant festive costume
  imaginable. At the front of the processionwere two women holding eight feet
  tall standards encrusted withdiamonds. One was of a stylised sperm and the
  other of a female eggrepresented as a sun. Two people on either side of the
  procession threwseeds along the pavements and halfway up the building, where
  theysprouted instantly into luscious green foliage, Following the twostandard
  bearers were the musicians, and behind them, on a goldenhorse-drawn carriage,
  stood the magnificently attired sopranorendering this beautiful aria in a
  voice that pierced my heart. Finally, onanother magnificent carriage drawn by
  half a dozen horses, followed awedding couple, and stunning they looked too.
  Their abundant
</p>
<p>
  happiness and joy at getting married was echoed by the cheerful crowdof
  wedding attendees who danced around the coach.
</p>
<p>
  After the procession had passed I turned my attention back to thetown. I
  thought about my car, and this triggered my waking intonormal consciousness.
</p>
<p>The art student17th June 2006</p>
<p>
  [meditated for about an hour but. my thoughts were relentless andinsistent
  upon my pursuit of them. This had a tiring effect, and feelingdemotivated I
  went back to bed.
</p>
<p>
  The moment I slipped into a dream I woke up in it. I was strollingthrough a
  vast art school, and recognised instantly that I was in anotherdimension. The
  exhilaration never diminishes when I realise that I amalive and awake not only
  in a completely different world but in anotherdimension,
</p>
<p>
  This was just like any art school on Earth, except that there werenot that
  many students about. In fact, I was reminded a little bit of myold art school
  days in Hamburg, where I studied to become a painterback in the early 70s.
  Just as then, here too were abandoned halffinished objects of art, discarded
  by the students who must havetealised that they had followed a dead end. We
  called them ‘artgraveyards’ back then. I picked up instantly on the sense of
  hope stilllingering in the pieces, which kept them just about alive. I
  recognisedthe inherent uncertainties of an artist, and it brought a smile to
  my face.These objects were extension of the students’ egos, and the sole
  reasonwhy they hadn’t disintegrated into the general matter of this
  dimensionwas the fact that they bore the emotional signature of
  attachment,which I could feel just by looking at them, but it didn’t stop them
  frombeing bad art.
</p>
<p>
  T approached a young student handling a large object suspendedfrom the
  ceiling, which looked like an enormous mobile. She was quiteengrossed in her
  work, but when I approached she greeted me with awarm and friendly smile. I
  was intrigued by her work and asked herwhether I could hold it. She nodded
  with a cheerful grin.
</p>
<p>
  It was extremely light, about two feet in diametre and on a fairlylong wire.
  It was constructed from a multitude of engraved metalpanels with fine wire
  woven intricately throughout it. I didn’t feelconvinced by it: there was a
  cheap - almost mass-produced - quality toit.I tried to hide my feelings from
  the student. I was disappointed, butvery concerned not to offend her with my
  thoughts at the same time.
</p>
<p>
  But she read my thoughts. “Oh, I didn’t do this,” she said. “I dovery
  different things.”
</p>
<p>I was quite relieved and asked her whether she would like toshow me.</p>
<p>
  She led me through the large hall of this enormous building to anupper level,
  which we reached via a huge and grandiose flight of stairs.Having been an art
  student at four different art schools in my youth, Iwas hugely fascinated and
  was dying to find out what went on behindthe doors leading to the various
  studios.
</p>
<p>
  T managed to have a glimpse into some studios with their doorswide open as we
  walked past. Some were occupied by couples whoworked in pairs, and some even
  had whole families working in them.Just from a quick glimpse I noticed that
  their work was concerned withrelationships. 1 was fascinated to find out more,
  but my newacquaintance ushered me along, keen to show me her work.
</p>
<p>
  We walked into a large new studio, clear of any clutter. In thecentre of the
  room, suspended in mid air at about eye level, was anextraordinary object,
  about half a metre tall, two metres wide and atleast thirty metres long.
  Several young women were working on itsimultaneously.
</p>
<p>
  The object was perforated by large holes and the artists wereworking inside of
  them. It reminded me of a cloud, although the woodand the denim-like fabric
  interwoven with cottonwool-like materialformed a strange, almost unnerving
  contrast. On closer inspection Idiscovered that the cotton wool was a luminous
  gossamer fiber, veryattractive, extremely light and intricately woven, showing
  marvelousattention to detail and artistic skill. I now realised why several
  studentswere working on the object simultaneously. This certainly was an
  objectdart, which had the rare distinction of being a completely new idea,even
  avant-garde.
</p>
<p>
  Tt was fascinating to watch the women at work. I noticed otherwork along the
  studio walls. Not all of it was high quality, but most ofit was enjoyable to
  look at. The work emitted an instant aura, whichspoke directly to me. When
  visiting modern or avant-garde art showsback on Earth, I had always required a
  little time to rid myself of mythoughts and preconceived notions in order to
  appreciate the workfully, but here there was no mental labour. As I walked
  past the work itspoke to me like a living entity. I now understood what was
  meant bythe ‘soul’ of a work of art. This is in fact a great feature of the
  nextdimension: everything has a soul, is animated from within and is easytg
  relate to, You get an instant wire to its innermost meaning.
</p>
<p>
  I then noticed that a person, unmistakably a tutor, had appearednext to me. He
  nodded towards a piece of work leaning against thewall in the corner of the
  studio. “Of course, some of it is crap, (quote)”he said, plainly.
</p>
<p>
  I was a little surprised, and amused at the honesty. Then hegrinned all over
  his face at me. I looked at the piece he was referring to.Tt was indeed bad. I
  felt it could have been a joke, or the work of someinnocent soul trying to
  create something modern, but having no idea ofhow to go about it.
</p>
<p>
  In all of this I had lost my companion, but I found her as soon as Ileft the
  studio. She ushered me along a huge hall, which opened into alarge auditorium.
  I realised that the abundance of space this buildingconsumed was an indication
  that space was not at a premium. Theyoung student had already reached the far
  side of the auditorium,where she waved, indicating for me to come over. With a
  bright smileon her face she handed me a programme and with her head shepointed
  towards an empty stage.
</p>
<p>“This is what I do.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” I didn’t understand what she was referring to.</p>
<p>“Read it.”</p>
<p>
  I quickly gathered that her work was a performance piece andwhat I was holding
  in my hand was the stage directions, but there wereno people to perform it.
</p>
<p>
  She told me that I would have to read the script and project whatT read onto
  the stage over there, The stage was not just a platform: itwas a work of art
  in itself, constructed out of intricate lattice work in
</p>
<p>
  black and ochre colour combinations. It gave off a luminous glow - anenergy
  field, which was loaded with expectation.
</p>
<p>I started reading, but the letters began to swim in front of my</p>
<p>eyes. I picked out individual words - I was unable to grasp a complete</p>
<p>
  Y sentence, let alone the script. I mustered all my attention to make some
</p>
<p>
  sense, but it left me mentally exhausted, and with that I woke up in mybed.
</p>
<p>
  After_I woke I ran through the whole event without changing myposition or
  opening my eyes, to impress it on my physical brain. This is howI generally
  bring back my impressions from the other dimensions. I alsovividly recalled
  another trip to an art college - an experience I had almostforgotten. I used
  the stillness of this state of mind to recollect it.
</p>
<p>
  It was about a group of artists whose ambition it was to create
  chaoticrandomness which could exist only on our physical planet, where the
  variousforces of nature, time and decay colluded to create a scene which one
  wouldgenerally describe as complete chaos.
</p>
<p>
  Here, the students expended considerable energy in emulating suchEarthly
  qualities, which brought home to me that fact that, on the next
</p>
<p>
  dimension, random chaos is a novelty noticeable by its absence. Everythingther
</p>
<p>
  is the result of intent, whether deliberate or unconscious. The
  momentattention is withdrawn from it, created objects dissolve unless a
  subconscious
</p>
<p>
  habit keeps them alive.This doesn’t mean that buildings and the like are of a
  fickle andtransient nature. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. I
  recalled being told= that some of the buildings were tens of thousands of
  years old by Earthstandards and were kept in existence hy the consensual
  awareness of thepeople living there. I also noticed that it was possible,
  despite all of this, toinfluence the architecture, perhaps by adding a
  gargoyle or changing thearchitectural detail, but that after I finished and
  withdrew my attentiongradually, the architecture would revert back to its
  original consensual state.All this makes the next dimension a very solid
  affair, much more solidthan here on Planet Earth, where the wind, rain and
  other forces of natureerode even the sturdiest of structures gradually. If we
  wish to experience acrisper, more profound reality, which carries more
  presence, then we have toleave this world behind and venture into the next
  dimension, which makeslife on this physical Earth appear like a very dull
  dream.
</p>
<p>
  I can well understand it when I read books by mediums reporting onthe
  excitement of the deceased in the next world, although there are manythings
  they do not touch upon. One of those things is the powerful realityfound on
  the other dimension. There is nothing wispy or vaporous about itItis like a
  constant communication with essence, an intense awareness. Thereis a more
  powerful connectedness to the reality surrounding us. It is as if,here on
  Earth, by carrying a dense physical body we keep ourselves apartfrom the
  reality of life
</p>
<p>
  On the higher dimension, life is very close and very intimate. Yet it is byno
  means a bed of roses. The challenges facing us have more to do with
  ourPersonalities and our psychology and how well we are equipped to use
  thisnew enhanced reality and environment for our personal development.
</p>
<p>
  There seems to be plenty of opportunity for escapism, throughsanctuaries,
  belief systems and personal heavens - and yet I have found thatlife on the
  lower dimension, which most closely resembles that of Earth, canbe very drab.
  Our mental and spiritual limitations can make the world
</p>
<p>
  | around us like a prison until we yearn and learn to break out and enter
  2higher dimension with expanded consciousness and enhanced
  creativeopportunities,
</p>
<p>
  I was surprised at how often I encountered inhabitants who didn’trealise that
  they were living in the land of the dead. Reality resembles that ofEarth so
  closely that slight differences, such as forms of instant transport
  areaccepted quite naturally in the same way we might accept driving on
  theopposite side of the road. If somebody lost consciousness and died and
  thenarrived on the other side he or she would need some convincing that
  theywere dead. There would be no change in the awareness of being alive.
  Theenvironment would most likely look exactly the same, being a copy of
  thephysical dimension. If they are not introduced by a friend, guide or
  relative,then they may wander about for a while, trying to piece everything
  together.Generally, the desire to gain clarity sends out waveforms, which
  attracthelpers. It appears to be exceptionally rare that people get lost. #
</p>
<p>
  I found that the heaven idea, or the ‘Summerland’ as it is often referredto in
  occult literature, appears to be a bit overstated. It would be moreaccurate to
  say that the environment we move into after exiting from thephysical dimension
  is a reflection of our state of mind. If we experience ourlife as repetitive,
  dull and uninteresting then there is no reason why thingsshould be different
  on the next level. If we are excited about life, inspired,
</p>
<p>
  positive and cheerful, then the environment on the next dimension willTeflect
  this.
</p>
<p>
  We are dealing with reality and truth. We can’t take a paradisiacalafterlife
  for granted and each individual will work for their own paradise,which is not
  an automatic process, but requires the same level of work as itdoes in this
  world; though you could argue that the absence of discomfort isa paradise in
  itself, like the absence of illness, aging, struggle, and working inan
  unsatisfactory environment. Yet I encountered many inhabitants on thenext
  dimension who, despite their limitless opportunities to explore andcreate,
  showed signs of boredom. In the end it boils down to employing thesame methods
  for happiness as we do here on Earth: by seekingselfactualisation and creative
  fulfillment, which alone will open the way intoa creatively enriched
  environment of serene beauty, splendor and unlimitedopportunity for growth.
  Death is not an automatic passport to heaven.
</p>
<p>
  The truth can be very harsh. It does not change with death, if anythingtruth
  and naked reality become more prominent after we shed our bodies.This is why
  it is important for us to lead an authentic life, focused onpsychological
  hygiene and away from selfish gratification. Unfortunately,depression and
  mental illness is a challenge which does not disappear afterwe have left our
  physical life. Many suicidal people will find themselves in adouble quandary
  when they realise that they haven't killed themselves at all, -\but have
  simply shifted their problems onto another environment. Havingsaid all that,
  people on the next dimension soon get the hang of making themost of the
  absence of their physical limitations and take full advantage oftheir new
  found freedoms in the most positive and creative ways imaginable.
</p>
<p>The art of enjoyment30th of June 2006</p>
<p>In my dream I was stranded on a high cliff overlooking the sea with a</p>
<p>
  small group of other people. Mighty waves kept crashing in front of usand with
  every wave the sea level rose.
</p>
<p>We retreated further and further up the hill until we reached the</p>
<p>
  very top. Still the giant waves, ten metres tall, kept rolling towards us.We
  seemed to be doomed.
</p>
<p>
  I decided the only thing left to do was to surrender to myinevitable end. A
  massive wave towered up in the distance and I knew
</p>
<p>
  this would be the last thing I would see alive. As it rolled towards us
  Iallowed myself to be ripped away and torn into the black depths of theocean.
  I sank deeper and deeper and when I started gasping for air Iknew that I was
  filling my lungs with water. But it didn’t feel as if I wasswallowing water. I
  was breathing as freely as I breathed in air.
</p>
<p>
  This strange fact brought instant lucidity. With this realisationcame the
  usual excitement and exhilaration of a lucid dream. Whiletumbling through the
  dark void I considered what it would be like if allmankind perished in some
  cataclysm. It wouldn't be that bad, Ithought, there would be no pain at all
  and no end, only a newbeginning.
</p>
<p>
  Soon I noticed that the blackness surrounding me was not waterat all and I was
  gliding through the air, drifting into a glorious dawn.Before I knew it I had
  landed on the roof of a magnificent building, fourstories high. It was
  designed in such a way that each floor formed aterrace. From the top terrace
  of the roof I could look down and see allthe terraces below me, each terrace
  was arranged in individual gardensand a seating area populated by a cheerful
  crowd of people, who inturn watched a jubilant and exuberant carnival
  procession going past.
</p>
<p>
  The atmosphere was instantly infectious. I felt high, which wasincreased by
  the realisation that I was awake in another world. I was sowide awake that I
  began to ponder the possibility that I may actually bein this place
  physically. I discarded the thought when I succeeded in
</p>
<p>
  floating ten feet into the air. This was incredible. I had died and now Iwas
  alive again - no, not alive, but super alive, super awake, with aclarity of
  vision, hearing and consciousness that was breathtaking.
</p>
<p>
  The exoticism and strangeness of the proceedings around meassured me that this
  was not some Earthly place, but a differentdimension or planet altogether.
</p>
<p>
  I was excited. There was not the slightest concern that myexcursion would be
  cut short by waking up in my bed. I felt I was hereto stay as long as I
  pleased. There were no pulls from my body; therewas no need for anything other
  than to explore and enjoy a new world.
</p>
<p>
  The procession on the street below me was in full swing. The only‘comparison I
  can come up with is the Carnival in Rio. I have witnessedseveral of these
  exuberant celebrations and it is obvious that theinhabitants of this realm
  have plenty to celebrate. What was fascinating
</p>
<p>
  was the incredible level of creativity used on the costumes. But it wasnot
  just the costumes: the people themselves had metamorphosedpartly into exotic
  animals and fantasy creatures, which was hilariousand awe-inspiring at the
  same time.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas on the physical world costume is all we can muster toexpress our
  individuality, imagination here had become physicalreality, and despite the
  diversity everything was in complete harmony.
</p>
<p>
  I was prompted to laugh out loud when observing parts of thedisplay: some were
  uninhibitedly erotic, with a whole group ofattractive women and men, half
  morphed into fantasy leopards,blatantly displaying their desires whilst
  indulging in a sexual danceroutine. Others had transformed into Gods and
  Goddesses projectingsparks and bolts of lightning into the sky using just
  powerful gestures.
</p>
<p>
  Inevitably every carnival has people on stilts, but these peoplehad genuine
  long legs and arms, allowing for more exuberantexpressions of their dance
  movements. There were dancing fantasyshapes, continuously changing, totally
  abstract and bearing littleresemblance to the people who had transmuted into
  them. There wereattractive alien creatures, white lights bursting from their
  insidesthough their metallic scales, illuminating the crowd around them.
</p>
<p>
  The people on the terraces below appeared to enjoy the display asmuch as I
  did. I thought it was time to cast my own worldly inhibitionsaside and join
  the procession below. I hesitated to jump from the topfloor to the street
  below for fear of experiencing the well knownsensation of uncontrollable
  falling, so instead I decided to jump ontothe terrace below me. As this was no
  problem at all I took one big jumponto the street, but not without indulging
  in some elaborate airacrobatics.
</p>
<p>
  Once I was among the party it was a whole new sensationaltogether. I had never
  experienced such uninhibited happiness on sucha large scale in all of my life.
  It was impossible not to be swept along bythe stream of happy emotions, of
  which there were no bounds.
</p>
<p>
  After drifting along with the crowd, I became conscious of thefact that I
  might at any moment have my excursion curtailed andwould wake up in my
  physical bed.
</p>
<p>
  I felt 1 owed it to myself to treat the occasion with a sense of‘scientific’
  curiosity. Carried by a powerful emotion I swooped up into
</p>
<p>
  the sky until the crowd below me was nothing more than a spec ofcolour.
  Majestic like an eagle I glided with the utmost confidence andease over
  magnificent countryside. I passed lakes and hills and then Ifound myself two
  hundred metres above a great forest.
</p>
<p>
  What attracted my attention was the fact that the forest appearedtobe
  luminous, and as I descended I discovered that all the vegetationglowed with a
  subtle iridescent light. It was not just the light that mademy heart soar, but
  the sheer richness and abundance of the plantlife.There was no way I could
  identify any particular species: everything Ilooked at had an extra dimension
  to it, the most prominent of whichwas its luminous aura - the life pulsating
  in the light streaming up thestems and out through the leaves and petals. The
  brightness andfrequency of the pulsing light differed from plant to plant, and
  so didthe colours, which were of qualities I had never seen or even
  imaginedbefore. There were so many hues - thousands more than on the
  physicalEarth.
</p>
<p>
  ‘This was a different dimension altogether. I was aware that thiswas ‘the real
  thing’ and that anything on the physical dimension wasnothing more than a
  faint copy, where much of the exuberance wasfiltered out by the increasing
  density of physical matter. Earth may bebeautiful, but this was on a far
  grander scale, which made all mymemories of beauty from my home planet appear
  almostimpoverished. I simply cannot do any of this justice with words. I
  feelalmost pathetic in attempting to describe it - it’s like trying to pick up
  abutterfly with a bulldozer. At the time, the only option I had was tostop and
  drink in the profound splendor and to fill every crevice of mybrain until it
  could contain no more. Maybe just to bear witness wasenough, and to say to the
  people back home, “Beware of all the beauty;repare yourself for the day you
  die so that your heart is big enough tohold a fraction of it.”
</p>
<p>
  It was only when I attuned to the tranquil scene that I relaxedutterly, and
  became witness to the symphony of sound, whichpenetrated my being in the
  subtlest of ways, totally unobtrusively,working its way finely to harmonise
  every part of my soul. There wassuch peace in the harmonies that I guess I
  must have rested among thegreen for many hours. Only very reluctantly did I
  decide to move on.
</p>
<p>
  I was saddened by the fact that there was no way to bring any ofthis back to
  the crude level I called my home. I did my best to impressmy memory there,
  knowing the limitations only too well.
</p>
<p>
  After departing finally and soaring away from the forest, I wasattracted to a
  tiny country cottage far below me. Before I had evencovered any distance I
  found myself sitting on a crude stone benchright in front of the house. I
  relished the simplicity of this place afterhaving been exposed to such
  excessive splendor, but the garden in frontof the house was still extremely
  pleasing to look at without demandingany attention.
</p>
<p>
  Conventional house design would normally serve some sort offunction, most
  obviously a place to live in - but this house was more ofan attempt at making
  a statement. It was like an externalised thought -an idea which wanted to add
  an element of function to give itself areason to exist. The house was a
  manifestation of a feeling. This wassomething I had come across before when
  visiting these realms. Part ofthe landscape or features provoked feelings that
  were simply not to beexperienced in the physical world. There are feelings
  which cannot beexperienced within a physical body, like a colour we cannot
  perceivewith our eyes. That's all I can do to explain it. This house was
  theessence of something new to me and the remarkable design only addedto the
  strangeness of the experience.
</p>
<p>
  While I sat on my stone bench pondering these sensations, I wasapproached by
  two creatures. The first one appeared to be a strangefour-legged cockerel, but
  as it came closer towards me, curiously andinquiringly, it could just as
  easily have been a majestic eagle. On closerinspection, the feet were like the
  paws of a big wild cat. The strangestfeature about it was its beak. It was
  square, and the top part of it wasengraved elaborately and incongruously at
  the sides, which struck meas being totally impractical for a giant bird of
  prey. Of course, I realisedthat prey in this world would probably not feature
  in a bird's life, andthe way this creature looked was overall rather
  dignified, with aharmonious handsomeness.
</p>
<p>
  Then, to my great surprise, the creature walked right up to meand pecked me
  gently on the cheek. It was almost like a human kiss,and I felt a wave of
  affection.
</p>
<p>
  The other creature, which was standing a little further back, was amammal, and
  the closest I can describe it as is a mixture of a dog and alion. It too came
  closer towards me, and then it licked me on the cheekin the same affectionate
  way as my family cat would have done. Thefeeling I had was one of kindness and
  affection.
</p>
<p>
  Before I could establish a more meaningful communication, ourthreesome was
  interrupted by a ‘friend’. I knew this person well, but Idid not know him back
  on Earth in my ordinary social life. He had agreat urgency about him, which
  shattered the tranquility I had justexperienced. I resented the intrusion, but
  he begged me to find someinformation to help his friend. He gave me no choice
  and I followedhim into the air. We rose what felt like many miles into the sky
  until wereached what appeared to be a natural boundary, like a layer of
  cloudsmade out of trillions of glittering discs. On closer inspection, I
  noticedthat this ceiling was made out of billions of tiny images. Some were
  likemoving collages. He urged me to go further and we entered a sea ofimages
  stretching infinitely in all directions. We both searched, but Ihad no idea
  what I was searching for and didn’t receive any clues frommy friend; however I
  was fascinated enough to keep searching or,really, to keep looking at these
  minute living images. I assumed that thesearch was triggered by attraction, so
  it would be possible to home inon the search quickly. But not knowing what to
  search for, I began tolose interest. At the same time I became aware of a dull
  pain in myshoulder, caused by lying in a strange position in my bed.
</p>
<p>
  T struggled to keep my waking awareness in this dimension, butit was of no
  use. My physical awareness was too strong. All I could dowas keep still with
  my eyes closed and run through the events I hadjust experienced to imprint
  them on my physical brain.
</p>
<p>The higher dimensions</p>
<p>Heavenly worlds</p>
<p>
  The higher a person ascends through the dimensions, the greater the powerat
  their disposal. They also become more and more aware of an
  underlyingintelligence, which_permeates everything in the world around
  them.Everything is animated and has intrinsic intelligence and a serene
  presence.It now becomes clear why everything functions so beautifully,
  following thelaws of attraction, imagination, and creativity, The feeling is
  that this is a
</p>
<p>
  Placid ocean of ‘compassionate’ intelligence, resting in a state of peace and
</p>
<p>CL awaiting human intent so it can make new forms and new creations.</p>
<p>
  Something remarkable is happening to the people who dwell in theseregions.
  Because there is an absence of separation, the overriding feeling isthat of
  being home. Every feeling of being home or the desire to be homecomes from
  this dimension. In the surrounding environment there is no suchthing as
  inanimate matter. All matter on the higher dimensions is intensivelyalive and
  intelligent. Even in the dimensions below there is a feeling thatwhatever is
  created has a presence and a life of its own. Matter is intelligence.I simply
  cannot find a more appropriated description. We will find that thenotion of
  ‘The Blind Watchmaker’, a theory which implies that naturalselection, an
  unconscious, automatic, blind yet essentially non-randomprocess that Darwin
  discovered, has no purpose in mind and implies in awider sense that everything
  created in the physical universe follows blindmechanistic principles, is
  simply wrong. Although there may not be acomprehensible definitive purpose, in
  my observation at the root of every
</p>
<p>17 Book by Professor Richard Dawkins, 1986</p>
<p>
  atom is a profound intelligence keeping it in motion. This principle holds
</p>
<p>
  true throughout all dimensions. Though whatever this intelligence is
  willprobably always remain beyond our grasp and human understanding.
</p>
<p>
  When human intelligence is trying to mold the matter of this
  dimensioncreatively, it responds with eagerness and enthusiasm. Every act of
  creation isaccompanied by incredible joy. There is a constant underlying
  feeling thatthis intelligence will communicate with us via ecstasy and
  rapture, themoment we pierce through the veil and enter its true nature. The
  veil is verythin at these highest levels and this intelligence can burst into
  existence at theslightest creative provocation. There is little discrimination
  between thecreator and the created as that which is created carries the ‘soul’
  imprint of itscreator. The identity of the creator is not restricted to a
  localised energy field,but can expand or contract by a simple effort of
  intent. The expansion ofconsciousness is multidimensional and transcends space
  and time.
</p>
<p>
  The inhabitants here and beyond this region have a symmetricalattractiveness
  and beauty, much more so than on the regions below. Thereappears to be a
  greater range of expression, subtly changing with finenuances when interacting
  with one another, whilst maintaining theiressential character and
  individuality. Interaction between people is veryintimate and intense and
  extremely rewarding.
</p>
<p>Sound, colour and shape are synonymous, sound creates colour and</p>
<p>{ pattern or shapes, and colour and shapes have a sound component.</p>
<p>
  To any artist this is the home of true creativity, which has infinite
  powerpotential. Against this, anything man has ever experienced or enjoyed
  onEarth pales into bland insignificance. By earthly time, it is possible to
  live inthis region for thousands of years without ever getting bored. The
  diversity ismore than we can imagine, simply because creativity in the next
  dimensionutilises sensory tools that far surpasses our own senses of sight,
  sound, smelland feeling. Pictures from Hindu mythology spring to mind, with
  theGodhead of a thousand arms and eyes, an appropriate way of depicting whatis
  opening before us.
</p>
<p>
  Even on the lower dimension people will get accustomed to new typesof emotion
  - subtle nuances that open up a completely new world of
</p>
<p>
  experience to us. Here, emotions that we have become accustomed to on
  thephysical level are cast away and are transmuted into sublime,
  incrediblyvaried forms of joy, which is carried by a brilliant intelligence
  and amultitude of nuances of ‘love’. Consciousness is expanded greatly,
  promoting
</p>
<p>ornea ee akwer Multidimensional Man lege Colors) £ ?</p>
<p>
  us to superhuman status. Every perception is more powerful, more evolved,and
  with new organs of perception we can enter new worlds so far removedfrom
  memories of our physical life that we may wonder at the grossness ofthe human
  creatures crawling on Planet Earth.
</p>
<p>
  On the higher dimensions there are still consensus_environmentscreated_by man,
  like cities and exquisite architectural wonders, but thecreative energies are
  so dynamic that they joyfully fill any mold created byhuman thought. The
  worlds here are at an essence level of creation. Anything,that it is possible
  to create is in existence and a soul relishing the abundanceof these universes
  can cover endless vistas of sublime landscapes and worldsof such profusion and
  wonder, that it is easy to be trapped and seduced bythem for millennia to
  come. These worlds cater for the fulfillment of all ourdreams in their
  essence, which we were unable to fulfill on the lower levelsand in an
  environment which is blissful in an endless variety of ways.
</p>
<p>
  Thave mentioned that the higher the dimension the more splendid andmore
  extraordinary its structure - not only its design, but its manifestation of
</p>
<p>
  ~subtle materials as well. The complexity, diversity and abundance
  increaseexponentially the finer or higher the vibratory rate of the
  dimensionbecomes. Aspects of colour, sound and feeling on these dimensions
  cannot bedescribed in terms of the physical. Scientists wonder what a particle
  andwhat a wave-form is, which one is light and which one is sound; but in
  thehigher dimensions they are one and the same thing, swirling around in
  anever-changing dance and pouncing eagerly and joyfully at any
  creativestimulus and opportunity in order to manifest it
</p>
<p>
  And yet, although we might consider this to be the goal and fulfillmentof all
  our dreams, an awakened person who enters this world will becomeaware that
  this is not the ultimate reality or resting-place if there is such athing and
  will quickly turn his or her attention to a higher level still, whichwill be
  the starting point of all our future evolution, once we have fullytranscended
  the animal kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  But as far as man at his current state is concerned, these are the trueheaven
  worlds, often referred to by the mystics and poets who visited theseregions
  and discovered that they were unable to express in words of whatthey had seen.
  For years I have struggled to express them with the help ofcomputer software
  and very often gave up before I even began, foreverfailing, not even getting
  anywhere close.
</p>
<p>Sublime environments</p>
<p>
  I wanted to conclude this book with a chapter about the highest dimensionsinto
  which I was privileged to glimpse. I have experienced only a few suchevents,
  and only two or three of these were experienced in a dimensionwhich I believe
  utterly transcended our human experience.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The following are descriptions of heavenly experiences, but they are byno
  means the highest levels attainable. When discussing those loftydimensions, we
  first have to accept that they are experienced in a totallyunfamiliar state of
  consciousness, expanded so greatly that there are no
</p>
<p>‘— words to describe the state of mind.</p>
<p>
  I will do my best to write down what I found along the way and how itfelt,
  just for the record; though I may not be able to put everything intowords. At
  the very least I can talk about effects. One thing is for sure, as wetranscend
  from the lower to the higher dimensions, life becomes increasinglytefined,
  harmonious, more euphoric and more glorious. The most importantaspect,
  however, is that with each ascendence into a higher dimension ourconsciousness
  expands in direct proportion to the magnificence surroundingus.
</p>
<p>
  I would like to include the next journal entry in this category, notbecause it
  was what one may want to describe as ‘spiritual’, but because itwas so sublime
  and serene and the person in it so beautiful that it had a veryuplifting
  effect on me.
</p>
<p>The lady in the blue room</p>
<p>
  2nd June 1976I woke up in a corridor of an exquisitely decorated house.
  Theatmosphere was such that I felt immediately at home. The thrill of
  therealisation that I had arrived in another dimension was enhanced bythe fact
  that this was a place of serenity, designed and decorated in away which showed
  exquisite taste and artistic skill. As I walkedthrough the rooms I was
  impressed by the attention to detail, that theowner of the house had brought
  to bear. I walked up a staircase.Everything was white, but the quality of the
  white allowed the sumtotal of all the colours pure white contains to dance on
  its surface in away which cannot be observed on Earth.
</p>
<p>
  The stairs led into a magnificent bedroom, held predominantly inshades of
  subtle blue, from the carpet to the walls, the curtains and thebedspread. The
  blue of the ceiling was such that 1 wondered whether itwas the clear blue sky
  itself. By the dresser, a beautiful young womansat combing her long blond
  hair, looking into a mirror, seeminglyunaware of my presence. Feeling very
  self-conscious at havingintruded into her private suite, I fumbled through my
  thoughts for theright kind of an excuse, while scanning for an inconspicuous
  retreatbefore causing any embarrassment. But the exquisitely beautiful
  ladysmiled at me via the mirror and uttered a soft and very welcoming“Hello.”
  This simple word conveyed the most gentle kindness I hadever experienced.
  These traits were expressed perfectly in her serenity -her pure skin, her
  noble eyes and cheeks and her perfect nose and herlips sculpted by a caring
  smile and a capacity for love.
</p>
<p>
  I was surprised by the familiarity in her voice, and then Iremembered her. We
  seemed to be very good friends. It was not even asif we had been separated for
  long, we were like two friends meeting intown by chance. Instead of talking we
  flashed intense and joyfulfeelings of sympathy towards each other. There was
  nothing else to say.Then I mentioned to her that I was lucid and had better
  make the mostof the experience before I woke up in my dull world again.
  Shelaughed, turned around and gave me a friendly wave. “Bye bye, then,”she
  smiled, letting me carry on with my ‘quest’.
</p>
<p>
  The feeling of goodwill from her left me happy and invigorated,and yet I felt
  foolish for lacking the courage to talk at length with her andrediscover our
  old connection. The fact of the matter is that I was simply‘overawed by her
  charisma and presence. This was a presence of kindnessfound rarely on this
  Earth level. Probably, most women cannot allowthemselves to be so generous
  with their affection to a man for fear of beingmisinterpreted as making a
  pass. Her lack of such self-consciousness wasemphasised by the totally
  unambiguous feeling of selfless love whichcould not be misinterpreted as
  anything erotic in the least.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The next thing I can recall was walking down another corridor. I amnot sure
  whether it was in the same house, but it was nevertheless thesame serene
  atmosphere. I passed by a large open window looking into alassroom. I saw a
  young teacher standing in front of a blackboard andhalf a dozen students
  sitting around a table listening to his lecture. He
</p>
<p>
  pointed to some beautifully calligraphed symbols on the blackboard,which I
  sensed had a strangely powerful and magical meaning. I made adistinct effort
  to impress their design onto my memory, so I could drawthem on my retum and
  find out what they represented. But instead Iremembered only their inner
  power. Surrounded by a beautiful blue light,which had traces of the light from
  the blue bedroom of my friend, Islipped feet first into my body. There was not
  even a break inconsciousness when I opened my eyes in my bed.
</p>
<p>
  The reason I included these reports under the Heaven chapter is simplybecause
  of the extraordinary pleasure they gave me, not only because of thescenery,
  but also because of great clarity and expanded awareness orconsciousness was
  so much more clear and lucid than anything I'dexperienced so far.
</p>
<p>
  The dancing maidenEarly July 1976In my dream I was traveling in the back of a
  car, studying the patternon the seat in front of me with the curiosity of a
  small child. At thatmoment I became lucid. Exhilarated by the thrill of my
  realisation, Ijumped out of the moving car without the slightest difficulty,
  despitethe fact that it had been traveling very fast. I stood next to the
  roadwatching the car disappear into the distance. I became aware ofbeautiful
  countryside surrounding me - lush green fields and treesbrimming with the life
  and the power of a sunny day in May. The sightwas so breathtaking that for a
  moment I felt like surrendering to thescene and allowing myself to be carried
  away in a beautiful dream, butT could not let this opportunity slip by, so I
  decided to deepen myEo consciousness by focusing on my hands, then on the
  ground,uwmi
</p>
<p>
  il I could see every atom in every grain of dust with a clarity of‘ind and
  mental alertness that was staggering.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that I had woken in a much higher dimension than I hadbeen used to
  filled me with great joy and happiness. Curiously, theroad I was walking on
  was of a deep, rich black, assembled frombillions of crystal-like particles. I
  could not believe that black could beso rich and beautiful. It was enhanced by
  wafts of colours, which
</p>
<p>
  drifted like luminescent mist across it, in pinks, greens and yellows,every so
  often releasing bright, enchanting sparks into the ait, whichfaded gently and
  invigorated the mists surrounding them with newlife. As I looked up I saw
  silver birches with cascading shimmeringbark and in the distance vast fields
  fringed by great forests.
</p>
<p>
  As so many times before, I noticed a familiarity that allowed meto place this
  dimension directly and accurately in the open countrysidenear my home town in
  Germany, a small village called Setrup. It wasuncanny how accurately I could
  place the location of this exalteddimension simply by its atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  The next thing I heard was singing coming from a group ofhappy people dancing
  towards me. Their song and their jovialityinjected my heart instantly with
  happiness. I tried to talk to a girldancing past me, but she laughed and
  danced around me and thendisappeared with her fellow troopers.
</p>
<p>Again, when I woke in my bed there was no break inconsciousness.</p>
<p>
  Birds of paradise7th October 1977Three times I woke up in my dream state.>
  First lucid awakening: I was talking to people in my dream,becoming fully
  awake and aware while maintaining my conversation.
</p>
<p>
  It was like holding a conversation with a neighbour, while becomingaware of
  the sunniness of the day. I am convinced that the people Ichatted to had not
  even noticed my change of consciousness. We justcarried on talking. Everything
  was the same as before. The surroundinghad not changed, nor had the people or
  the conversation. I wasdistracted only briefly from our conversation by the
  realisation that
</p>
<p>
  y- many dreams are probably as real as waking life, except for our lack of
</p>
<p>awareness. I wondered how many dreams were real.</p>
<p>
  Being aware of myself in this novel state, I excused myself fromthe company
  and drifted like an ethereal creature, without any effortwhatsoever, along a
  corridor. On one side of me were large Gothicwindows, almost touching the
  floor, and ahead of me, at the end of thecorridor, was an equally large door
  inviting me to enter the next room.
</p>
<p>
  As the door opened (I couldn’t tell whether it was as a result ofmy intention
  or by some invisible hands) I entered a large room with agathering of people.
  There were different age groups, but all wereengrossed in intense
  conversation. One thing that struck me as odd wasthe fact that they were all
  much taller than I was. Even the childrenwere tall.
</p>
<p>
  1 couldn’t be sure whether it was my height, or lack of it, orwhether it was
  the fact that I was a stranger, which drew me someattention. But the attention
  did not make me feel uncomfortable. In fact,nearly every glance towards me was
  accompanied by a friendly smile.Just when I was about to address one of the
  group, I became aware ofmy physical consciousness and woke up.
</p>
<p>
  Second lucid awakening: I become frustrated by the fact that thepull of my
  physical body prevented me from pursuing in-depth
</p>
<p>
  , investigations, but, as_soon as I closed my eyes I became instantly| aware
  and awake in the next dimension, It was as if 1 had poked myhead through a
  ceiling and become aware each time of a different room.
</p>
<p>
  This time it was an ordinary, tastefully furnished sitting room,quite
  ordinary, which seemed vaguely familiar. What attracted myattention was the
  window, which looked out onto a bright summerygarden. The fact that on the
  physical level it was a cold and rainyOctober day only added to my desire to
  move outside. I had alwayshad an issue with opening windows on this level and
  had becomeaccustomed to passing straight through them instead. The glass felt
  likethick soft plastic, which yielded to my touch and then just popped likea
  bubble, dispersing into tiny droplets.
</p>
<p>
  The brightness of the light, the warm summer air and the lushgreen and
  plentiful flowers had the instant effect that I soared blissfullyinto the sky.
  But only too suddenly my journey was cut short.
</p>
<p>
  Third attempt: I closed my physical eyes again. I was back in thesame sitting
  room, standing in front of the same window, looking outinto the garden. Before
  I attempted anything I told myself to stayfocused on this dimension and under
  no circumstances slip out ofwakefulness or return to my body. I stepped back
  from the windowand then hurled myself with arms outstretched through the
  glass.Again I felt the rubbery resistance, then popped through it and out
  intothe garden. The serene beauty of the surrounding abundance had an
</p>
<p>
  instant invigorating effect on me, which allowed me to rise like ahelium
  balloon into the air. The more lucid my mind became, the moreinvigorating the
  colour. Some flowers glowed like paper lanterns inprofuse colours, the sizes
  of their exuberant heads exaggerated. Whowas all this beauty for, I wondered?
  Who created it? I was taking in theextravagance of the display when a short
  distance into the garden, anunexpected wall obscured my view. Its main purpose
  appeared to be toact as a contrast to a multitude of exotic growths, each
  competing inmagnificence.
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult, if not impossible, to describe the feelings thesesurroundings
  evoked. I realised how much more intensively I was ableto see with my heart -
  in fact, with my whole body. The creationstriggered a sympathetic vibration
  within me. In our home dimension, Imight see and enjoy the beauty of a summer
  garden, but I could stillseparate myself from the experience and think of
  other things. I wouldbe fleetingly aware of the beauty, but thinking already
  of doing otherthings. Here it was a total experience. Each musical string of
  colourvibrated in my heart, the different nuances of which evoked newemotions,
  overwhelming one moment, delicate and hushed the next,leaving me vulnerable in
  the love of it all.
</p>
<p>
  Just beyond the wall on the other side was a small and happystream with
  crystal clear water, playing continuous chiming notes. Ifyou have spent some
  time alone, maybe as a child, by the side of asmall brook and listened to the
  water, enchanted by the rhythmic yetever-changing notes you will have an
  inkling of what I found. But itwas not just the melody of the water which sang
  and worshipped thepeace, it was the fact that it played for me. I was the
  object of itsdevotion, and its music was for me. We were entwined intimately
  likelovers, gently and gracefully.
</p>
<p>
  As if the sound was not beauty enough in itself, it emitted coloursinto the
  air that mutated into continuously changing shapes.
</p>
<p>
  And then there were the birds who were careful not to intrudeand draw my
  attention away from the water. Despite the fact that theywere dressed in
  colourful plumage, synchronising perfectly, yetcontrasting with their
  surroundings, they remained perfectlysynchronised. In this part of the
  universe, plumage was simply a wayof expressing perfection, unity and harmony.
</p>
<p>
  Gradually, I noticed more birds sitting in the hedgerows,bouncing on tender
  branches, and flapping from tree to tree. Theywatched me with interest,
  intelligent and unafraid. The idea that theywere animals suddenly appeared
  absurd. I mused how our dimmedvision on our physical Earth condemned our
  animal companions intocategories of lesser beings, which we could exploit for
  our ownsurvival, pleasure and greed. These birds were essences of
  intelligence.As if to prove my point, one huge parrot, with a wingspan of four
  orfive feet, soared high above me, nobly, its confidence taken from thevery
  spirit of this world. Then he swooped down towards me indecreasing circles and
  when I stretched out my arm he landed lightlyon my hand, despite his size.
  After a few seconds he took to the airagain. When I stretched out my hand to
  bid farewell, I found to mysurprise that he had left a dark, square object
  attached to my arm.
</p>
<p>
  Before I could even ideniifyor decipher the gift I woke up. Ihavetried to
  re-enter this exalted realm so many times, but I have managedonly dreams.
</p>
<p>
  Friendly people13th July 1977I was standing in the middle of a country road,
  which meanderedthrough green fields with an abundance of flowers, when I
  acquiredfull waking consciousness. I can’t remember which was the most|
  powerful, the beauty of the surroundings or the exhilaration that I
  hadVtravelied into a higher dimension. Probably, it was both. I wasoverwhelmed
  with joy.
</p>
<p>
  It was midmomning. The sun was bright and warm. Its powerfulrays_had_a
  personality, which welcomed me and clarified myconsciousness even more. If
  only I could feel so alive in my normalwaking world, I thought.
</p>
<p>
  Then I saw a young woman riding a horse along the pathtowards me. I decided to
  talk to her. She seemed to realise my intentionand rode closer, bending
  towards me with a friendly smile. She wasextremely attractive, with long blond
  curly hair. She had a greatpresence and a sublime nobility and everything
  about her radiatedgrace. Gazing at her made me feel shy. “Excuse me,” I said,
  “are we on
</p>
<p>
  the Astral Plane?” I felt stupid even before she burst out laughing, butit was
  joyful, disarming laugh, which caused me to warm to her. Iasked: “Do you mind
  if I ask you a few questions? I rarely get the‘opportunity to come here and I
  would like to find out more about thisworld.”
</p>
<p>
  "Why don’t you come with me to the village and we can talktogether?” she
  invited me.
</p>
<p>
  “Thank you - yes, That is a great idea,” I replied, but instead offollowing
  her I was overcome by the urge to express my new foundfreedom by somersaulting
  into the air and bouncing through thebeautiful flower-strewn fields. When I
  looked for her, she had gone, butI wasn’t concerned. I began to enjoy the riot
  of colour surrounding meand the freedom I felt as I soared through the sky.
  Where I expectedclouds to be, I found instead layer upon layer of colours, all
  movedabout by the rays of the sun, weaving through the high grass belowand
  rising into gentle swirls of pinks, blues and lilacs. The colourfulfields
  stretched in all directions, before disappearing into a luminousmist.
</p>
<p>
  When I landed I examined the grass, which was of a richshimmering green. When
  I dug my hand into the soil it was made frombillions of tiny crystals, not
  like physical Earth at all. I let it pourthrough my fingers, which made a
  sound like tiny crystal bells. Thiswas heaven. Everything about this place was
  rich in colour, sound andsplendor, a place where I could stay for months, if
  not for years, if notforever. Sadly, I became aware of my body For a while I
  clung to thefamiliar_dual-consciousness, which allowed me to be in two worlds
  atthe same time, but I could not hold on to heaven much longer. I made alast
  effort to follow the invitation of the young woman, but time hadrun out. I was
  torn away physically and soared into the air. Two dogshad appeared on the
  scene and they chased after me playfully on theground. The call from my body
  became stronger and finally I openedmy eyes. There_was no break in
  consciousness. I had gone fromwakefulness to wakefulness. All that had changed
  was the dimension. Ispent a long time lying on my bed reliving the experience
  and allowingthe joy and the exhilaration to seep from me.
</p>
<p>Another universe, another world</p>
<p>23rd July 1976</p>
<p>
  I was dreaming of diving in and out of traffic in a big city. In myfrustration
  I lifted up into the air, and at that moment I became lucid. Ikept rising high
  above the city. As I sailed eagle-like across the sky, Iobserved the most
  beautiful panoramic landscape. The crescent shapecity was at the mouth of a
  huge river pouring its mighty waters into theocean. Beyond the city were
  mountains reaching miles high, stretchingas far as the eye could see, The
  vastness and splendor of the landscapewas breathtaking. It was so beautiful
  that I lingered in the air, taking inthe sight, planning to make a mental
  impression, to bring back to Earthin order to paint it.
</p>
<p>
  Then, without warning, a tremendous ‘supernatural’ forceplucked_me out of
  mid-air and carried me away with frighteningspeed. I had no power over it. I
  tried to see what was happening orwhere I was being taken, but everything was
  black. I couldn’t see athing, I started to panic and found myself fighting and
  resisting theforce sweeping me into the unknown. Slowly the force relented
  andabandoned me in a place familiar and close to home in England. I had
  astrong feeling of regret and wondered what might have happened hadI
  surrendered to the force, just allowed myself to go with it. With thisthought
  in my mind, the same force picked me up again and in no timeat all it
  dumped_me into an environment so alien that I spent agestrying to identify any
  features that would remind me of anything I hadseen before. Gradually, as my
  eyes adjusted, shapes of unrecognisableobjects emerged out of the vagueness. I
  was on an alien planet. I sawwhat resembled a body of water, but it wasn’t
  water, it was a crystallineliquid mass, shimmering and shining. The objects
  floating on orhovering above it could be described as flowers, but they were
  notflowers. Similar plant-like entities grew around the pond and seemedto be
  on fire. Flames were coming out of their roots, but it was not fire.It was
  iridescent light rising from the ground and up through thestems.
</p>
<p>
  The thing that was the most striking of all was the indescribablebeauty, the
  harmony that the objects created among themselves andwith their environment,
  and the sounds that rained down on the scene,together with the cascading
  lights emanating from the crystalline pond.
</p>
<p>
  The crystals were of an indefinable colour, which one moment Ithought was
  silver and bluish the next, getting darker towards thecentre of the pond,
  acquiring a rich, deep violet. Pearlescent doesn’t doit justice. The borders
  between what was sight and sound becameblurred and what a moment ago was a
  liquid object moving inharmony with its surrounding turned out to be a sound
  with a shape,and so I was never quite certain whether it was a sound I saw or
  acolour with a shape I heard.
</p>
<p>
  Drawn as if by intensely irresistible magic, I moved closer to thepond, while
  the sounds became more enchanting, sweetly luring mecloser into their midst.
  What could have been interpreted as acacophony of sounds was in fact a grand
  symphonic masterpiece.
</p>
<p>
  I floated towards the edge, weaving between big burning stemsand waving
  shapes, which sent showers of colour like sparks into theair every time I
  brushed past them. Unlike dandelions, their abundanceof ‘seeds’ were never
  exhausted and instead drew new breath from thefertile earth on which they
  grew.
</p>
<p>
  Now I was at the very edge of the pond. Through the indigodepth of the liquid
  I saw large silver bubbles rising to the surface, up totwo feet in diameter.
  Momentarily I wondered how much of thisbeauty I could absorb, because not only
  were my visual senseschallenged to the full, but my heart was struggling in
  vain to contain allthe joy. The bubbles burst with a musical ‘pop’ when they
  reached thesurface, releasing sounds dressed in misty puffs of colour, which
  rainedback down onto the liquid surface. None of this appeared to berandom;
  everything had its place in this grand symphony of colour,and sound, The
  harmonies were multilayered and seemed to sustainthe very existence of this
  planet.
</p>
<p>
  Then I noticed a soft, almost wet feeling on my feet. I lookeddown and
  realised I was standing on grass, which formed a soft furryskin over the
  landscape. Even this, when I moved through it, emitted ashimmer of musical
  notes.
</p>
<p>Finally, I dipped my toes into the liquid.</p>
<p>
  It was not like water. It was not even wet. It was a sensation I canonly
  describe as invigorating. As I looked in awe and childlike wonder,I saw shapes
  appearing around the edge of the pond and before I knewit a group of six or
  seven men and women joined their songs with the
</p>
<p>
  sweetest sounds of the lake. Their beauty, could only be described asangelic,
  but never having seen an angel I was at odds to identify wherethey came from
  and who they were. All I knew was that their beauty‘was as harmonious with the
  scene as their song was with its music.
</p>
<p>
  I was entranced, and the joy this gave me was from anotherworld. I cannot
  compare it with anything I have experienced before.There were joys, millions
  of joys. On Earth there may only be a few, buthere there were nuances of joys
  playing harmonies on my soul, like themusic of a harp.
</p>
<p>
  Then, as the song faded, the world became quite. I felt a peaceand stillness
  sweeter than even the music, and I was part of it. I wasblessed; sanctified.
</p>
<p>
  Gradually, my enquiring mind got the better of me. I had to findout what had
  happened. I had to know were I was. I turned towardsthe group and when my
  voice finally broke to the surface I felt like abull in a china shop. My voice
  was polluting - it was destroyingsomething with its total irrelevance, and yet
  I was unable to stop it.
</p>
<p>
  “Excuse me for intruding,” I said. “Could you please tell me,what plane...what
  level of life I am in?”
</p>
<p>
  The people looked at each other, bemused. One turned towardsme, not quite sure
  what meaning was behind such a question. Theycouldn't imagine being on any
  other plane.
</p>
<p>
  I thought of a way of putting the question more precisely. “Am Iin heaven?
  What is heaven anyway?” I heard how inadequate andcrude my words were - how
  inappropriate even my thoughts were.There was no point to it.
</p>
<p>
  It was as if by using my mind I had de-etherialised this world,and gradually I
  lost my grip and found myself in my body, but notquite. I was in another room,
  surrounded by people. I told them in thebest way that I could what I had
  experienced, flashing images of mymemory at them, redrawing the scene and
  conjuring up the sounds. Ihad a keen audience: some of them were relatives of
  mine, who haddied many years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Then I woke up and sketched down on paper what I hadwitnessed. Had it not been
  for the fact that I had related the events toan audience on the other
  dimension, I doubt that I would have beenable to bring the memory over to this
  world.
</p>
<p>Silver worldsJuly 24th 1977</p>
<p>
  I had an intensive and long lucid dream. Unfortunately, I failed toimprint the
  events on my physical brain before returning to my body,hence most of it got
  lost. The experience which left a clear memorybehind was quite unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
  When I became lucid in my dream I used the Castaneda’®techniques in order to
  deepen my awareness and establish full wakingconsciousness. This meant
  focusing my attention on my hands.However, I was horrified to find instead of
  my hands two ugly claw-like stumps, shrivelled up and filthy. Seeing a mirror
  nearby, I lookedinto it and was shocked to find it covered in filth. I used a
  basin to washmy hands and face until I felt I was clean, but when I looked
  into themirror again I found to my horror that my face was covered in
  plant-like scabs. I felt diseased and impure and struggled in vain to
  ridmyself of the impurities.
</p>
<p>
  A little later during the same episode I was fighting an irresistiblesexual
  urge, which was triggered by the company of three females,who did everything
  in their power to encourage me to have sex withthem. It would have been too
  easy to surrender, but I resented the factthat I was being manipulated. All my
  attention was taken over by verybasic instincts over which I had no control.
  The moment I relentedslightly to the power of these urges, my alertness and
  wakingconsciousness became dulled and numb and I slipped into a drowsydream.
  The women, in their roles as seductresses, did everything theycould to lure me
  into this dark and blind reality.
</p>
<p>
  Under normal circumstances, the easiest and most natural thingwould have been
  to allow the sex drive to take its course and unload itspower through the
  dream and leave me feeling relieved and relaxed inthe process. At this point,
  however, that was the last thing I wanted. Iwas craving the purity and sublime
  joys of a higher consciousness, as Ihad experienced before. The result was
  that I awoke,
</p>
<p>
  18 Castaneda suggests in his “Teachings of Don Juan” to focus on the hands to
  gain tucdity,
</p>
<p>
  The mirror experience and the lack of control made me realisethat there was an
  area in my subconscious mind which demandedurgent attention.
</p>
<p>
  Without getting out of bed I went into meditation to purify myconsciousness
  and after about twenty minutes I was prepared toconfront my demons. Almost as
  soon as I hit the pillow and closed myeyes I was out of my body and fully
  lucid again.
</p>
<p>
  This time I found myself floating above open countryside, thenroof tops.
  Occasionally, my energy was sapped away and I descendedto the ground.
  Gathering positive feelings I rose into the air again untilI managed finally
  to maintain a consistent altitude. Beneath me I sawstreets, rivers, fields and
  hills. Finally I came to land on the roof of alarge mansion.
</p>
<p>
  A few hundred yards away from the house I saw a couple. Thewoman pointed at me
  shouting. “Look, there is another deep sleeper!”
</p>
<p>
  I turned towards them, amazed at hearing them so clearly oversuch a distance,
  and I said to her: “Yes, you are right - I am a very deepsleeper, but wide
  awake.” The woman looked at me and giggled.
</p>
<p>
  Then I took off again. After soaring through the air I felt more atease in my
  new surroundings and towards the horizon I saw aluminous band of colourful
  light. The attraction was irresistible. As Igot closer I found that the whole
  land was made out of silvery light, sobright in fact that it proved rather
  uncomfortable to my eyes. Its pullhowever was irresistible.
</p>
<p>
  I speculated that this at last may be the heaven so many talkedabout. My heart
  beat with joy and anticipation. Slowly and gently Idrifted downwards,
  accustoming myself gradually to the light. It wasas if I was stepping out of a
  dark cellar into the bright sunlight at noon.Beneath me shimmered a silvery
  sea of light and before me stretched anenormous valley through mountains
  higher than any mountain range‘on earth. A long series of lakes passed beneath
  me, every oneindividual yet all in perfect harmony. Each new feature of
  landtriggered a new kind of feeling. I recognised this as a giant pattern
  ofcreation, which became more intricate as I rose higher again.
</p>
<p>
  Yet this was only the beginning. Beyond the valley, lights risingfrom the land
  promised new splendors, which made the current scenebeneath me appear like the
  black of night. The closer to the lights I got,
</p>
<p>
  the more familiar I felt with my surroundings. This, I felt, was wherethe word
  home came from. This was the essence of home, and when Ifelt or said the word
  ‘home’ in the physical world it was only a faintreflection, a frail memory,
  too far removed from its essence of the realhome to have any real meaning at
  all.
</p>
<p>
  Curiously, the most challenging feeling to bear was the intensityof the joy I
  felt. I was unprepared for it. It was a joy synonymous with ablinding light,
  which became more intense and closer to pain thefurther I travelled inland,
  until I could not bear it any longer. The storyof Icarus came to mind. I
  needed to return before I was burned up inthe flames.
</p>
<p>I opened my eyes in my bed.</p>
<p>
  After this experience 1 was haunted by the possibilities of enteringdimensions
  I'd only heard or read about through remote religious fantasies,magical tales
  and fairy worlds. There have been travelers to these worldsbefore me, who have
  tried desperately to convey a feeling or a description ofthe environments. I
  can understand why they likened it to our physical skywith its shining soft
  clouds, as indeed there were ‘clouds’ - glorious bands oflight of
  ever-shifting colour. What on this Earth can be more beautiful than acloud?
</p>
<p>
  I could see the frustrations of my predecessors who had travelled tothese
  regions, knowing perfectly well that whatever the description theycould
  deliver, in words or in images, it would fall desperately short of theirtrue
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  In the cold light of physical day, I realised it was not heaven I had beento:
  it was a dimension as real as Earth, yet so far removed from our
  limitedexperiences that it cannot be described here. I had to go back. I had
  to findout how it worked, what it was made of, and how it came to exist.
</p>
<p>
  In the next few days, this was all that was on my mind. It was as if hadtaken
  a sip from the fountain of life, and I needed more. I knew that what Ihad
  touched upon contained the reason for the existence of everything onEarth -
  the origin of all images, all words and all human desires,
</p>
<p>aS ages, all words and all human desires. _</p>
<p>Stairway to heaven</p>
<p>
  1th August 1980It had been such an exhausting night of lucid dreaming, that I
  forgotmost of it by the morning, having failed to imprint it on my brain.
  Ihadbeen visiting ancient civilizations, but only fragments of myexperiences
  were left. More importantly, I had been put to work by my
</p>
<p>
  @-silent_companion to assist a number of dying people, helping themacross to
  the other side.
</p>
<p>
  I felt mentally exhausted and rested, fully awake, in a beautifulmeadow. My
  full waking consciousness was enhanced by an intensefeeling of ‘being’, which
  turned my surroundings into a place ofparadise. Unexpectedly, my younger
  brother had joined me and I wasdelighted to see him. It was the most perfect
  summer’s day and theatmosphere was full of joy and promise. I said to my
  brother that weshould use the opportunity and explore this land a bit more,
  like a niceholiday. I also told him he should make sure first that he was
  fullyawake. He laughed as if I was joking.
</p>
<p>
  ‘As we walked through the sublime countryside, the light and thebrilliance of
  the day become more glorious with the distance wecovered. A steep path
  meandered upwards towards a great summitwhich seemed miles above us. This was
  the route we chose for ourwalk, drawn naturally towards the peak of the
  snow-covered mountainin the distance, especially as there was no physical
  exertion involvedwhatsoever. On either side of our path were entrancing fields
  with richgreen and flowers you can find on earth in tropical gardens, A
  smallstream spattered down the hill towards us in beautiful melodies.Relishing
  the splendor and the rarified air we felt inspired by the factthat we might be
  walking towards heaven. Rather than reaching thetop, though, we found that our
  path kept rising higher and higher,without ever actually getting closer to the
  summit.
</p>
<p>
  Finally we arrived at a structure, which resembled a grandcathedral, sitting
  on a large plateau. It was a round, ornate building,which reminded me of the
  basilica of St. Peter’s in Rome.
</p>
<p>
  19 I checked with my brother later, to see if he could remember anything. He
  coull—~—
</p>
<p>
  Looking back down the mountain, we felt as though we hadcovered a huge
  distance. We rested among the splendour of oursurroundings. Compared to the
  sight we enjoyed presently, the area wehad come from appeared dark and murky.
</p>
<p>
  As we entered the hall I was aware of an intense yet invisiblepresence,
  benevolent and loving, which gave me an intense and lastingthrill.
</p>
<p>
  The whole interior of this great sanctuary was taken up by agigantic
  staircase. If I said it was made out of gold it would be an insultto the
  architect. On either side at the bottom of the stairs stood two
</p>
<p>
  i gigantic beings about seven or eight feet tall. They radiated greatauthority
  and wisdom - but it was the authority of Jove, which couldunder no
  circumstances be assailed. This love gave us the courage toascend the
  apparently endless flight of stairs.
</p>
<p>
  The stairs high above us were shrouded in golden mist, whichdrifted in waves
  towards us, shimmering with every step we took.Each step was like entering the
  territory of new and unfamiliardimensions, which increased my clarity of mind
  the higher we rose.
</p>
<p>
  Despite the fact that I had never been here before I had theimpression that I
  was on home ground, on my own turf. The place washauntingly familiar, as if I
  was just about to return to the place of mybirth. My heart began to beat
  heavily with anticipation and every stepgave mea thrill.
</p>
<p>
  I looked around and saw my brother waiting on the stairs,carrying a simple
  earthenware goblet.
</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for?” I asked.</p>
<p>
  He pointed to the goblet, which he held in one hand, and showed‘me that it had
  dirt in it. Wes ty md
</p>
<p>
  “I have to go back,” he said. “I have to clean it.” He turned andwent down the
  huge flight of stairs again. I said that he didn’t have togo all the way down
  again because, the atmosphere here is so pure itwould take care of it - it
  would clean it right here. He held up thegoblet and soon the dirt began to
  clear, but not all of it. He looked at itand told me that he would have to go
  down to clear the rest butperhaps not all the way down.
</p>
<p>
  His decision to turn made me feel uncertain, and the scenearound me began to
  fade as I returned to physical awareness. I had
</p>
<p>
  been close to my true home. The experience was still present - therewas hardly
  a break in consciousness. With my eyes still closed I sawpart of me completing
  my ascent and disappearing into a brilliant light.I was still holding the
  bright light and the golden staircase in my mindwhen I opened my physical
  eyes. Bliss spread through me. My headwas filled with light. The symbolic
  meaning of the lotus flower becameclear to me. It has its roots in the mud
  underneath the water, but itshead was breathing fresh air and enjoyed the
  light of the sun. This ishow our lives should be, I thought; while our bodies
  toil in the denseatmosphere of the world, our spirit should be exposed to the
  sun.
</p>
<p>
  It took a while before the feeling ebbed away. I pondered whetherother people
  had been to that place before me. Jacob's Jadder, the grandstairway to heaven,
  an interpretation of the mind’s expandingconsciousness as it enters higher
  dimensions. It was as real as the bed Iwas lying on. I felt transformed,
  purified. The light in my head dimmedgradually, but when I got up, the silent
  presence which had greeted mein the hall was still there, alongside me,
  watching me pouring boilingwater on the tea bag in my mug and putting bread
  into the toaster. Itwas there sitting with me at the table having breakfast.
  When I lookedup, it was in the furniture, in my sweet wife who came down
  sleepilyand gave me a kiss, carrying our young daughter.
</p>
<p>
  It was still there later that morning when I said hello to ourneighbour, and
  in the car that went past me when I rode my bicycle towork. It was on the
  pavement and even in the litter bin. Despite thebusy studio where I worked,
  there was a stillness at work: the staff,involved in their usual role play,
  were like ripples on a placid lake. I feltgood inside and glad that nobody
  noticed. And as for the light in myhead, I only had to remember it and it was
  there again, while my bodycarried on as usual.
</p>
<p>
  I thought about rainy days, thunderstorms and dark heavyclouds, and I realised
  that it didn’t matter what the weather was like:all the time the sun above the
  clouds shone constantly.

<p>The final frontiers</p>
<p>The final frontiers</p>
<p>
  How is it possible that events we regard as happening only within our
  threepounds of brain tissue can be as real as in our waking life? How is it
  possiblethat we can experience worlds inside our heads so much grander than
  theone we encounter with our eyes open? How can we possibly tie
  theseexperiences merely to the firing of nerve-endings in our physical
  brains?What is this brain anyway when it is broken down into its constituent
  parts?It is no more and no less than a galaxy of energy: particles, atoms,
  protonsand electrons, and so forth. What and where are these particles? Are
  they onthe inside or the outside? And is there such a thing as inside and
  outside?Where does the territory of our being begin and end?
</p>
<p>Where do all our experiences really take place?</p>
<p>
  I cannot decide which is the more miraculous: our out-of-bodyexperiences as
  the result of electric activity between nerve endings within ourbrains, or as
  the result of activities in other dimensions. To me the formerseems to be the
  more outrageous and far-fetched. Some skeptics insist thatout-of-body
  experiences are phenomena of neural function and that what weexperience is
  probably no more than a fantasy. Yes, but what is this fantasy,and where is it
  enacted? How does a chemical process create it? Does it notmake more sense to
  extend the established fact of this worldly dimensionwith all its still
  unsolved mysteries into another dimension? This wouldmake more sense and would
  allow us to approach the whole complex issuefrom a more scientific angle.
  Simply, it will not do for people to put peoplewho have out-of-body
  experiences into a metaphorical new-age loony binjust because they cannot
  bring themselves to accept that there are things inthe world that we cannot
  explain with the logic of our left brain hemisphere.For many, if it is not
  testable by traditional scientific methods then it does not
</p>
<p>
  warrant serious investigation. Could it be that certain scientific methods
  mayjust be a little too limited?
</p>
<p>
  From my point of view, as one who has been subject to out-of-bodyexperiences,
  I find it more plausible and ‘down-to-earth’ to consider that alllife in the
  physical universe is the offshoot of a multidimensional super-universe.
  Multiple-universes theories have been made already by string-theorists, though
  whether the dimensions I am speaking of are anything likewhat they had in mind
  is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, scientists will have to abandon their pursuit of the
  unifyingtheory of everything (or M-Theory), because the new dimensions are
  beyondthe scope of language in this three-dimensional environment.
</p>
<p>
  I think that in order to penetrate deeper into the mysteries of creationmore
  use should be made of the right brain hemisphere, by focusing onsound beyond
  words, on intuition rather than mathematics, and on directexperience rather
  than hypothesis. Perhaps in a hundred years from nowScientific experiments may
  be conducted in new ways.
</p>
<p>
  Counting the nerve endings and cataloguing and categorising the partsin our
  three-dimensional skull, may bring big benefits in understandingbehavior and
  the phenomena of our cognitive systems, but they won't solvethe core mystery
  behind our fantastic brain. And for scientists to considerany form of
  space-travel beyond the solar system, they may have to considerrevolutionary
  nonphysical means of travel. Many out-of-body travelers willtell them that
  they can save themselves billions of dollars by focusing their
</p>
<p>
  — efforts on a specific point within their brain in oder to open the wormhole
  toanother galaxy. I have already documented how time travel works in aPrevious
  chapter™, All that is needed is a scientific mindset to access the
  rightinformation.
</p>
<p>
  At present, many out-of-body experiences don’t take us much furtherthan beyond
  the ‘I'm flying - isn’t that amazing!’ level. People feel it is saferand
  socially more acceptable to talk about traditional scientific methods
  andexperiences, so that they can keep face in front of friends and colleagues.
  AParadigm shift towards new science may requires a bold, slightly loony (inthe
  eyes of most) explorer, who is not overly concerned about his image,
  whobeavers away quietly in his out-of-body laboratory until he emerges
  sleepy-eyed with the first live ‘broadband’ link to our deceased relatives.
</p>

<p>Preparing for the ultimate adventure</p>
<p>
  Thave nearly reached the end of the book, and I feel I should end it with
  oneof my most sustained and powerful experiences to date. Although it
  wasentered into my journal way back in 1980, it was one of the most
  in-depth,most vibrant out-of-body experiences I have ever had, spanning
  severalhours and penetrating into the heart of creation, or what I saw as the
  core
</p>
<p>
  dimension of reality. It is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid using
  overly-
</p>
<p>
  poetic language or the terminology of the mystics, because simply there is
</p>
<p>
  not as yet a common understanding of what pure reality is. I hope you will
</p>
<p>look beyond my limitations and employ your own intuition to fill in any</p>
<p>gaps, because I am certain that what I experienced may ring strangely</p>
<p>
  familiar to some people. You may have already been there in deep sleep, but
</p>
<p>unable to bring it through the physical barriers of the brain. What I saw</p>
<p>
  appears to be at the very core of our nature and I find it impossible to
  believe
</p>
<p>that I am on my own in having experienced it.</p>
<p>
  Apart from noting down the most important points in my diary overseveral
  pages, I relied on the non-verbal power of my right brain hemisphereto keep
  the memory of what I had witnessed in a more intuitive and visualformat than I
  could have recorded on paper. Even now, using deep +meditation to recall and
  to a degree relive the event, I struggle to avoid cliché |when describing it.
  Yet the event gave me a new perspective on many of themysteries of our being.
</p>
<p>
  The super-reality I experienced in this state of consciousness madeordinary
  life appear almost trivial - like random thought, not even a dream. Ihave the
  feeling that consciousness on these high dimensions may be ourfuture common
  ground as a human species. Compared to this, we in ourpresent state of
  evolution are like some prehistoric creature emerging fromthe mud.
</p>
<p>
  The powers available to us will be immense. We will be interwovenintricately
  with a supreme cosmic intelligence. We may already be thebeneficiaries of our
  future selves, who can project themselves into any one ofour past, present and
  future lives and assert a guiding influence if so chosen.We are our own
  guardian angel, spirit guide and mentor. We are our ownGod. We become the one
  who answers our prayers. Only then will we be, asthe Christian bible says,
  “created in the image of God”.
</p>
<p>
  I would not be telling the truth if I claimed that leaving my body
  andtraveling into new fantastic worlds in full waking consciousness
  andexperiencing total freedom was not one of the most incredible adventures
  aperson could ever dream of. But as unbelievable as it may sound,
  exploringdimensions beyond the physical was not the key quest of my adventures
  -the reason being that I had tasted something of considerably higher value”.
  Inever spoke about it, perhaps because I was afraid that my art studentfriends
  at that time would refer to it as the ‘cheese sandwich experience’,cheapening
  it to simply rye bread and Tilsiter cheese, rather than the moreglamorous
  sounding ‘Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus’ experience I thought itwas. Modern
  psychology would probably be kinder and call it ‘a peak-experience brought
  about by excessive neuron activity within such-and-sucha part of the
  whatsitsname cortex’.
</p>
<p>
  I never saw it as anything more than a ‘wake-up call’, which put thereality of
  my life into clear perspective. Compared to the rich wine of thatexperience,
  out-of-body-experiences were like water. I saw it as a beacon inthe landscape
  of my life, to which I could direct my course. I had a new‘outlook in my life,
  Any experience I had from then I compared instinctivelyto it, and no matter
  how extraordinary they were they always left mewanting more.
</p>
<p>
  It was that experience in 1972 which made me rediscover meditation asthe way
  forward. For the next eight years I stuck to a strict regime in order to
</p>
<p>
  -< unearth similar experiences. All I wanted was the simple truth of who I am
  -the truth behind appearances; to find out what reality was, untainted
  byperception, conditioning and opinion. This had always ranked as the
  numberone goal of my journey through life. Out-of-the-body experiences were
  like akind of sideshow - perks that came with the job. Ironically, I had
  neverenvisaged that this ‘sideshow’ would ultimately unravel a spectacle
  ofcosmic proportions. It became clear that the path leading me beyond thebody
  was the path of my destiny and that the ‘show’ aspect was simply inkeeping
  with my visionary nature as an artist. But I cannot say with anycertainty that
  this facet would have developed at all had it not been for myintensive
  meditation practice.
</p>
<p>
  Now I am much older my meditation is more accomplished, intensiveand
  prolonged, and out-of-body journeys are less of an issue and so occur
</p>
<p>21 See page J, chapter Ancient Masters</p>
<p>
  much less frequently. The real benefits of meditation are that I have
  gainedcontrol over my thoughts and consequently the quality of my life
  hasincreased exponentially. Despite working hard to earn my living, often
  forsixty hours a week, my life has become more rewarding and enjoyable,carried
  on a note of thrill and joyful anticipation. I practice meditation everyday
  without fail as part of my routine. What I thought of reality back in 1980was
  different to how I experience it now.
</p>
<p>
  One would think, therefore, that such a profound inner experience asthe
  following would more likely have happened in later years. In fact, ithappened
  nearly thirty years ago, when I was a relative novice in yoga. Butall this
  shows is the relative value of such ‘cosmic visions’, whereas now Iknow that
  awareness of reality has a much more profound effect on life thana night out
  of the body. I suspect the following experience was simply theculmination of a
  powerful desire to uncover the core level of reality or truth,to find insight
  and understanding rather than a constant awareness of aliving present. It was
  underpinned by stillness and the quiet underlyingecstasy of being alive, which
  is much more part of my life now.
</p>
<p>
  At the very least it gave me a hint of the origin of the greater reality,which
  is at the very basis of life and gives an inkling of things to come.
</p>
<p>
  The final journey25th August 1980Thad a restless night with only patches of
  sleep. I got up very early,about half-past-four in the morning, and went into
  my studio intendingto meditate in order to go back to bed to catch up with
  some muchneeded sleep. Meditation was great for this. Not only did it relax
  me,but I had discovered that it could initiate a drowsy dreamlike state,which
  felt very wholesome and enjoyable. I would then almost_- sleepwalk back to my
  bed with my eyes hardly open and sink instantly— into a deep, blissful sleep.
</p>
<p>
  But I wasn’t tired at all. I looked at some of the paintings I hadproduced
  during the previous weeks. One in particular caught myattention. It was
  abstract, four feet by three feet, created with broad freebrush strokes. I
  always strived as best as I could to destroy anyemergence of pictorial imagery
  in the painting in order to remainpurely abstract and I thought I had
  succeeded with this work. But I
</p>
<p>
  hadn’t. Now it was like I was looking through the gaps of a half-opencurtain
  into another world. True, there were no pictorial elements, butthe painting
  was anything but abstract. It was an unworldly landscape
</p>
<p>
  — cast in pink and blue lights. The feelings this evoked startled me. I
  waslooking at something I had never seen before. Only once before had
  Iexperienced something similar: when I looked at a painting by MarkRothko; but
  that was on a quite different level. This went far, far deeper,probably
  because it was my painting.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I closed my eyes and began to meditate. Then I must havefallen
  asleep.
</p>
<p>
  In my dream I was walking with a small group of people throughwild
  countryside. The colours were rich and vivid. Abundant mosscovered huge fallen
  trees and it was as if I was walking through apainting by the German romantic
  artist Caspar David Friedrich, or a
</p>
<p>
  film set for The Lord of the Rings (which, of course, is my view
  fromhindsight).
</p>
<p>
  Gradually the scene began to change until we came to a halt infront of a huge
  incongruous piece of architecture blocking our path. Infact, its presence was
  so monstrous in its monotony that I wonderedwhat freakish power had put it
  here. It was so out of character with the
</p>
<p>
  — environment that I realised at once that I was ina dream. I paused to letthe
  realisation sink in until I had establish full waking consciousness.The people
  I had been with were no longer there. I was on my own.
</p>
<p>
  Out of curiosity I entered the building. I was aware more thanever that in
  this world objects had little function other than to serve assymbols,
  signposts or challenges. This was the world of mind-over-matter rather than
  matter-over-mind. Contemplating its significance, Ientered the building and
  found myself in a gigantic hall. At the verycentre was a large spiral
  staircase that went so high that I could hardlysee the top.
</p>
<p>
  Without further delay I walked up the staircase and soon driftedrapidly
  towards the very top, just under the roof. Here the stairs cameto an
  inexplicable stop. There was no door, no window - not even ahatch. I knew
  instinctively that in order to get out of the building andonto a higher level
  I had to break through the roof.
</p>
<p>
  With my bare fists I started punching a large hole into the roof.Big chunks
  fell out of it as if it was made from porous plasterboard.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I climbed through the hole in the ceiling and onto a largeplatform.
  To my surprise I found myself in open countryside withgroups of trees on
  either side, only to realise with awe that I was in theinterior of a still
  larger hall, enclosing the whole countrysidesurrounding me.
</p>
<p>
  I recalled my battles against the ceiling obstacle in the past? and Ibegan to
  wonder whether I was again embarking on a fruitless effort tofight against
  these formidable barriers. Nevertheless, I wanted to findout, so I soared high
  through the hall until I reached the ceiling. I evenadmired the beautiful and
  intricate plasterwork, reminiscent of ancienttemple designs, with gigantic,
  exquisite floral patterns. Yet this was oflittle interest to me and I hacked
  my way through the ceiling with totaldisregard for its artist. Then, climbing
  onto the roof, I found myselfsurrounded by glorious countryside. Pondering my
  adventure, Ilooked into the sky and found to my astonishment that it was
  ornatewith gigantic intricate swirls and patterns. Then I realised that it
  wasthe inside of a huge dome, the roof of yet another gigantic hall, miles
  indiameter but an enclosed space nevertheless. s
</p>
<p>
  Instead of getting annoyed I sat down and thought about myexperience - not
  just that I had been ascending through various domes,but the stupendous and
  much more profound fact that my personality,my life - my whole being - was by
  now fully transfered into differentreality. Admittedly, this always happened
  whenever I first realised thatI was conscious in another world while my body
  was still asleep, butthis felt different. It_was as if I had uprooted and
  relocated for good.There was no urgency at all to go back to my body and the
  possibilitydawned on me that I may have become a resident here on a
  permanentbasis. On the other hand I still had a vague link to another
  world,which was taking care of my sleeping body. I knew I could reconnectwith
  it simply by shifting my attention, but this was not on my agendanow. I was
  more puzzled by the strange mystery of the experience andits overwhelming
  reality.
</p>
<p>
  I figured that I was surrounded by mere symbols and yet thesymbols looked as
  real as buildings back on Earth. I was astonished by
</p>
<p>how my mind dealt with the phenomena of multidimensional reality. It</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>22 See chapter Breaking down baries</p>
<p>
  had no way of conceiving the reality of this experience other than
  bytranslating it into comprehensible symbols of stacked rooms. There was
</p>
<p>wisdom in the way these mysterious forces guided me onwards</p>
<p>through unknown territory using signposts I could understand.</p>
<p>
  I felt no desire to rush back to my body. My presence in thisworld was fully
  established, and there was no need to worry aboutbeing interrupted. I might
  just as well have been in another country,physically - it felt so real.
</p>
<p>
  The great clarity of my wakefulness and the superb power offocus I was endowed
  with made me realise that I was on the verge of agreat discovery, of
  conquering new dimensions, which had beeninaccessible until now. Fate, or
  whatever else it was, had endowed mewith this luxurious waking consciousness
  in this nonphysical world,and it was a great blessing. All I had to do now was
  proceed withdetermination and focus.
</p>
<p>
  With these insights I rose again into the air like a balloon until Ipassed
  through yet another ornate ceiling. This time I didn’t even haveto use
  ‘physical’ force but passed straight into another massive hall,filling me with
  excitement and expectation. The light in this space wasfar brighter and came
  from all around me.
</p>
<p>
  The feeling was much more uplifting and I was carried on astream of energy,
  which pulled me onwards like a giant magnet, higherand higher towards a
  ceiling, which dissolved before I even got close.
</p>
<p>
  This was extraordinary. The atmosphere was much brighter stillthan before,
  more penetrating and yet very subtle, reaching into everyatom of my being. I
  began to feel uncomfortable. It was like coming infrom the cold into to a warm
  room, still wearing a heavy coat.
</p>
<p>
  It became unbearable. Something had to give. I was no longer acohesive entity.
  I was conscious that my body was being unrelentinglypulled_apart atom by atom.
  The old molecules, which had made mewhat I thought of as myself, wanted to
  resist, seeking some snugshelter somewhere in a darker region no longer
  reachable. I felt like acondemned man, dying a nonphysical death. But in the
  end it was onlymy resistance which had to perish. Letting go of my attachment
  to my
</p>
<p>
  novel costume - my body, which I had been wearing for millennia - wasin fact a
  great liberation. This was the individual which had clung tomy physical
  disguises time and time again, exchanged for a new one
</p>
<p>
  whenever the old one was worn out. I was keen to take a look at thevast
  spectrum of these veils - an endless chain of lives, paraded inmillions of
  images in front of my disembodied eyes.
</p>
<p>
  The process began to feel joyful once I understood not to cling onto_the old
  heavy matter of my bi burden of the past.Whatever the forces were that ripped
  me apart, they did so not becausethey wanted to destroy me, but out of love,
  pure and unconditional.They wanted me to join them, become part of them, so I
  could entertheir native realm.
</p>
<p>
  There was no turning back. It was as if I was pulled by invisiblestrings, all
  eager to call me home. This was accompanied by a sweetand beckoning sound,
  which evolved into a choir of enchanting sound,with voices so sweet that there
  was no way I could have resisted.
</p>
<p>
  I left behind all that I had valued so much, which was really littlemore than
  idle games played with childlike earnestness, and dreamsindulged in and
  lifetimes struggling in search of happiness.
</p>
<p>
  With my new pair of eyes I became accustomed to my newsurroundings as if I was
  coming into sunlight for the first time afterbeing trapped in a dark dungeon
  for years.
</p>
<p>
  Before me a sea of pleasure opened in warm sparkling waves anda disembodied
  soprano voice urged me to plunge my heart and soulinto this open ocean.
</p>
<p>
  I was not alone. There were millions like myself, sparkling orbs,the souls of
  others, bobbing along on a vast expanse of coloured light,attached to sparking
  filaments fused to a living counterpart down)below in some distant darkness.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever their blind and ignorant physical counterparts were upto, indulging
  in meanness or basking in love, their lights up here werebarely affected by
  what went on below.
</p>
<p>
  After the ecstatic storm of my transformation had passed, therewas peace. It
  was like a gathering of my new critical faculties; acalibrating of my new
  instruments of perception. I soon forgoteverything I had learned in the
  limited world of Earth and began toprepare myself for a totally new cognitive
  experience. I was not ina >place or in a time any longer, or in any form;
  instead, I was everywheresimultaneously, except there wasn’t a ‘where’ at all.
  There was just I.
</p>
<p>
  Yet I was also aware of another presence, which had been with‘me all this
  time. I still couldn’t see it, only knew that it was beside me.It was like
  another me, watching, guarding and guiding.
</p>
<p>
  I thought my journey had ended - I'd reached a unity which gaveme a great
  peace and a clarity of mind, which I drank eagerly. I hadreturned from an
  endless, exhausting voyage, and now it was my timeto rest. I was home at last.
</p>
<p>Thoughts and belief systems</p>
<p>
  The journey continuingThis was not home for very long. I heard a roll of
  thunder and the airaround me began to vibrate. On all sides, shapes started to
  emerge outof the light. I noticed that I was standing in the centre of a
  giganpointed patter, which rose up around my feet to form a massive,immensely
  intricate flower reminiscent of a magnolia. It spread out inall directions and
  as it grew it elevated me to dizzying heights, andbefore I knew it I was
  staring down into the infinite depth of space. Butthis expanse was not black
  like our Earth's universe, it was lit by
</p>
<p>= myriad spellbinding objects.</p>
<p>
  Thoughts are curious things, made out of words. Within ourphysical brains they
  appear to be abstract things, attached to objects,which in themselves have no
  substance whatsoever and are strungtogether by recollections of meanings. In a
  sense we are their creatorsand with them we form worlds around us. Until now I
  hadn’t realisedthat here they were living ‘physical’ realities.
</p>
<p>For a while now I had been aware of a beautiful entity, like</p>
<p>y breath unformed, attached to me with gentle hands, giving me a thrill</p>
<p>
  L-which pulsated through my new body. The moment I became aware ofit, it
  detached and unfolded in front of me like an enormous bloom.
</p>
<p>It was love.</p>
<p>
  And now it had become a thought, a detached object I couldobserve objectively.
  Its inner life had taken on the pulsating power I
</p>
<p>
  had felt earlier, and it spread out and unfolded in the space before meas a
  large symmetrical flower. A breath ago it was just a bud, but now itopened
  into even fuller bloom as I pondered its secret. It was evolvingcontinuously,
  drawing its life force seemingly from my attention. From
</p>
<p>
  its centre, incredibly elegant blooms unfolded on spiraling stems
  andpirouetted around one another in a joyful dance. The moment theytouched
  they merged and showers of golden dust exploded and otherblooms were spawned,
  even more beautiful than before. This in turninitiated a whole generation of
  blossoms to emerge, forever varyingand evolving in abundance, At the centre of
  the blossom a coreappeared like a fruit and evolved into an organic shrine
  opening itswalls, with blooms sprouting around its entrance beckoning me
  toenter, to rejoin and merge with the love which was so much part of mebefore.
</p>
<p>
  But I was too distracted to enter, as an endless armada of giantthought shapes
  was drifting in front of me, each vying for my attention.I could pick on any
  shape at will and its living reality surrounded meon all sides and offered me
  its inner secret. Some were giganticstructures, alien and complex and of
  beguiling mystery and beauty.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Their textures, design and character differed tremendously fromthought form
  to thought form, as did their colours and sounds. It wasonly too easy to be
  seduced by any of these shapes and to apprehendtheir inner meaning. They liked
  nothing more than attention and drewtheir sustenance from it. They were
  animated by a quest for expansion,grabbing sympathetic energy in their path
  like greedy exotic seacreatures. They wove their way around alien matter,
  growing as theygrazed on the energies being sent towards them by orbs of
  light.
</p>
<p>
  Some of them formed colonies covering large territories. I saw theformation of
  whole ideologies and theories, creating complex worldswithin themselves. From
  up here I could see countless belief systems asincredibly complex shapes. I
  saw that once immersed in any of thosestructures the perspective of the world
  changed for good. The centre ofthe thought felt like the centre of the
  universe itself, It was difficult toargue against them, each vying for space
  and attention.
</p>
<p>
  How easy it seemed for people to become seduced and ensnaredby these grand
  designs. The sheer presence of them, how each thoughtprovided refuge,
  belonging and identity, because beyond themappeared to be nothing but dark and
  empty space. How many people, Ithought, understand that they have the power to
  rise above andobserve these thoughts for what they are: temporary resting
  places, nomore than inventions, giving us the illusion that we are in control.
  And
</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>Multidimensional Man</p>
<p>
  yet they were as fleeting as clouds. When my interest waned andattention
  withdrew, they withered away into nothingness.
</p>
<p>
  I was fascinated by this powerful display. The passions andenergies invested
  in them made them shine and stand out like grandedifices, singing the glory of
  their creators, many of them hypnotisedby their beauty and artistic
  perfection.
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, majestic_structures drifted through my field ofvision with great
  authority, rolling slowly through the vast deep spacelike gigantic alien star
  ships, so vast that I could barely see where theyfinished. Millions of orbs
  were attached to them, attracted by theirsheer size and presence, enjoying the
  ride and the company of fellowcrew members. It was driven by a powerful engine
  at its centre, whichwas nothing less then a gigantic star, sitting at the top
  of a magnificentdome for everyone to see. Inside the dome, millions worshipped
  it liketheir God.
</p>
<p>
  Another big spaceship caught my attention. This one had the coolbeauty of
  complex geometric ornamentation, joined together skillfullyby billions of
  intricate patterns and shapes like crystals, arrangedingeniously to
  perfection. When looking for its mode of propulsion, Isaw that huge blue orbs
  of light were its energy source, pulling it along,mining knowledge from the
  deep mysterious space surrounding it. Inits wake it created new geometric
  shapes, which were harvestedeagerly and absorbed into the structure of the
  gigantic ship. Any otherforms it encountered were probed with purpose and
  curiosity.Occasionally it unearthed gigantic treasures, which reverberated
  andreconfigured the ship's design and greatly increased its power. Its
  greatauthority was undeniable, because it was multidimensionallyexpanding,
  both laterally and vertically, sending its beneficial energiesinto the worlds
  below. Awestruck by its precision, its clear-cut beautyand perfect design, I
  watched its slow, but unrelenting progress andadmired the scientific ingenuity
  of our species to create such grandstructures. Its charisma was one of
  rationality and reason, cool andmeasured.
</p>
<p>
  There were millions of such shapes. Some small but evolving andgrowing, others
  lumbering and fading into the ocean of billions ofthoughts that burst into
  life, clustering around each other like living
</p>
<p>
  creatures. This was an enormous world, a whole universe in itself -
  thecreation of man: Gods and creators in our own right.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas on Earth my attention could explore each thought onlysequentially,
  here, from a dimension above, freed from the linearprogramming of the physical
  brain, I could read each structure in itsentirety instantly, simultaneously
  appreciating its substance andessence. It was impossible not to marvel at
  these magnificent edifices,their monumental construction and seductive
  three-dimensionalpattern of beguiling symmetry, colour and proportions, woven
  togetherwith celestial craftsmanship, radiating out from their
  mysteriouscentres.
</p>
<p>
  Here on this level, thinking was no longer an effort but animmense pleasure of
  observation and detached contemplation, whichmade it easy to observe the
  limitations of thoughts themselves. Fromup here I had a perfect viewpoint. I
  could zoom in to them and absorbthem instantly in their essence.
</p>
<p>
  I was in philosopher's paradise. The world of human mind. Theheaven of
  inventors, artists, mathematicians, scientists and religiousbelievers.
</p>
<p>
  I felt great freedom in the exploration. Each structure had areason to be and
  to exist, just like any other creature in the world; theywere products of our
  species, borne out of need and the desire forknowledge and understanding. They
  were the songs of our thirstingsouls.
</p>
<p>The infinite vistas of paradise</p>
<p>
  The journey unfoldsA gentle voice, which I at first mistook for a song,
  whispered into myear and prised me from my contemplation.
</p>
<p>
  “Look upon this playground of the mind. I dare you not to beseduced by it. In
  all your dreams you won't find greater amusementthan this.”
</p>
<p>
  This gentle voice was posing a question and was attempting, byits very
  gentleness, to demolish the world I had began to admire so
</p>
<p>
  much for its sheer grandiosity. The imperfections of what I saw beganto lose
  their power to seduce. I felt sorry for my fellow souls, who were
</p>
<p>
  trapped in them, forever seeking comfort and identity. I could seeclearly how
  passionately they would defend their positions, arguingtheir point of reality
  - they would even go to war for it. I studied theirirreconcilable differences
  of frequencies and character. Often theirauthority was taken only from their
  size, sometimes from the beauty oftheir design. It was clear that there could
  be no clear winner. All theirpassengers were attached to their systems rather
  than the reality oftheir own individual being.
</p>
<p>
  I felt_a rush of wind, as if I was flying through the air at greatspeed, but I
  was not moving. I heard distant thunder. The worldaround me began to shift and
  I wondered what other sights lay in storefor me. The wind was actually a
  familiar voice whispering gently intomy ear. I could not tell the words - it
  was a different language, nothuman. But somehow I had the impression of what
  it meant: it wasannouncing that I should prepare myself to visit the
  penultimate dreamof all humanity.
</p>
<p>
  The thunder was accompanied by electrical activity around me.With a thrill I
  felt the huge lotus flower underneath me growingrapidly, spreading out in
  every direction until it formed the shell of anenormous celestial structure,
  large enough to contain the wholeuniverse. Ihad taken residency inside a grand
  cosmic temple. The wallswere made out of liquid light, continually solidifying
  and transforminginto new precious materials, beaming with ever changing
  patterns. Icould see at once where the architects of the great mosques on
  earthhad received their inspiration from.
</p>
<p>
  In every direction was an entrance or an exit, yet eachtantalisingly close by.
  Through each gigantic portal I could glance intothe vast vistas of different
  heavens, infinite landscapes lining the manyavenues leading out through the
  gates. Each route out of this cathedralwas a highway into another heaven,
  lined by magnificent arches as if toglorify the approach.
</p>
<p>
  The walls of this enormous edifice were cycling through preciousmaterials,
  casting off energies in the forms of light and patterns ofalternating
  complexities, like a giant exotic sea creature. The temple, ifthis word is at
  all appropriate, was alive and was illuminated bycountless little orbs like
  myself. They sparkled in different colours andpermutations of expression, some
  bright, some calm and sedate, but
</p>
<p>
  each one individual. Streams of them migrated joyfully through thevast gates
  to disappear into their heavens. On closer inspection, I sawthat most of them
  were still attached to shapes which they had claimedfor themselves in their
  own worlds, fascinated by their power and
</p>
<p>
  drawing strength from them. It were these thought forms they werestill
  attached to, which would determine the nature of the heaven they
</p>
<p>
  would enter. It was clear to me that from each orb’s point of view theymust
  have felt that they alone formed the centre of this sheer endlessplace, and
  that their chosen heaven was the true destiny for every otherperson on Earth.
  It was easy to see why, because each formed the centrefrom which the cosmic
  lotus flower radiated out, and each formed thepetal of the adjacent one so
  that the whole merged into an infinitetapestry.
</p>
<p>
  “Humans find their identities here. They spin their webs ofphilosophies,
  religions and beliefs. Some get caught in it like a fly in aspider's web; some
  use it to spin their dreams and spend manylifetimes to unravel and fulfill
  them.” The voice whispered to me.
</p>
<p>
  But my attention had already wandered towards one of thosehovering portals.
  The temptation to explore one of these vistas wasoverwhelming. The mere
  thought was enough to overpower me, and Ientered one of the irresistible
  tunnels, which was huge and bright, andlined with impressive columns on either
  side, and above and below.Peering through the columns as I travelled along, I
  saw the sceneryspread out infinitely and I could have taken any of those side
  openingpathways and entered a new heaven of staggering diversity andwonder.
  People here could spent eternity exploring these fantasticheavenly universes,
  experiencing their never-ending joys andfreedoms, not getting tired or bored
  for a single moment.
</p>
<p>
  I found myself accelerating through the vaulted tunnels.Occasionally, I
  drifted past hosts of heavenly creatures like schools offish, rejoicing in
  song, On all sides new realms opened up like galaxies.T glanced into openings
  into other worlds, each one as vast as the one Itravelled through, promising
  unimaginable pleasures. I was lured fromall sides by fine soprano voices,
  which combined with all the otherjoyous songs creating a complete symphony. It
  was surely here, Imused, that our great Earthly composers received their
  inspiration.
</p>
<p>
  But I sailed straight on, past all of these temptations, which couldnot
  satisfy my hope that there was something more profound than this.
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly there was a pull from another direction. It was I,myself. I realised
  that I had been seduced by a dream, a mere wish,which was only a thought, a
  possibility, and that reality was far morethan this. I was back in the temple.
  The voice spoke to me again, softly,gently, as if not to disturb my
  contemplation.
</p>
<p>
  “You are right. This world is a grand illusion, put in your path totrick you -
  to keep you fascinated and imprisoned as a limited being.
</p>
<p>Yet to many people on Earth what you’ve just seen is the dream of all</p>
<p>dreams come true, the heaven of all heavens. And indeed, compared to</p>
<p>
  life on the dense Earth, this truly is paradise, where people spend{-
  Millennia exploring the vast scope and vistas of heaven and its joys.”
</p>
<p>
  The voice now sounded more human and very close by. I wasbeing guided by a
  very old friend, who faded in and out of my vision.One moment it was a
  brilliant orb of light and the next a beautiful facematerialised, sculpted by
  a serene sense of humor, boundlesscompassion and love. Then it faded again,
  revealing itself as a presence,extending and merging with the surrounding
  world.
</p>
<p>
  The stillness and peace that followed was an indication thatsomething was
  going to happen. Then I noticed that the silence was notsilence at all, but
  was a sound I had had no facility to hear before. Adeep boom gave me to
  understand immediately that all I had seen sofar was child’s play, that it was
  time to wake up out of my dream andembrace reality.
</p>
<p>The inner core of reality</p>
<p>Same event continuing</p>
<p>
  Until now we have been dealing with dimensions, which, although difficultto
  describe or imagine, are still within the realms of our human experience,
  amental realm. The difficulty we are faced with in reaching into thedimensions
  beyond are that we are leaving the realms of knowledge,imagination, thinking
  and understanding. In short, description is simplyimpossible, because we are
  dealing with consciousness that transcends ourhuman experience. Until now,
  conventional thinking has served us well aspart of our evolutional
  development. We have learned to refine it to such a
</p>
<p>
  degree that we are able to manifest the most sublime concepts of our
  intellectand weave structures of incredible complexities resulting in the
  mostfascinating and uplifting earthly and mental heavens imaginable. To
  reachbeyond all this the mind is nothing but a burden and an obstacle. In
  order toget close to our true nature, all form of thought must perish, and
  with it ouridentity as limited human entities. In its place a new illuminated
  mind takesup position. At the basis of all conventional thinking is an
  awareness of thefinite, Our mind is simply incapable of comprehending anything
  outside itsown nature. Although we may have words for it like eternity,
  infinity, God,universal consciousness and their like, they will never provide
  a true insightinto states of consciousness which go beyond thinking. This is
  the veryreason why the Buddha is silent. This should not distract us from the
  factthat this is a natural state of consciousness which lies at the heart of
  all of us,in our innermost being. As such it can be called upon by way of
  attention.‘And we don’t have to be great sages to claim our natural heritage
  as thefollowing experience will illustrate.
</p>
<p>
  The difficulty though remains, it is almost impossible to conveysomething that
  is beyond thoughts, word and our general means ofcommunication. In oder to
  convey the experience all I am left with are aroundabout descriptions of
  symptoms, residues I was left with and it is onlythese I can convey. This is
  as far as I can go.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The presence near me reassured me that I was safe, but that I wasembarking on
  a new dimension altogether for which there was noprecedence. The sound I heard
  was like the OM®. I had used it in thepast while out of my body and now I
  realised why it had always hadsuch a powerful effect. But this was far, far
  more. It was the sound itselfmaking the sound, which was itself.
</p>
<p>
  What happened next was to challenge my human comprehensionto its limits.This
  was in unknown territory. I relied on the presence - which
</p>
<p>
  —was not human, yet like an old friend, a mother and father combined -to guide
  me. It was an incredibly intimate experience, and I was awareof it in my soul.
  I felt trust, absolute and unconditional - so much sothat I offered myself in
  total surrender to the presence.
</p>
<p>230Misa mantra used in eastern mysticism, the sound of creation.</p>
<p>
  The world around me faded. The sound transmuted into thebreaking surf of ocean
  waves.
</p>
<p>It was born.</p>
<p>Istood on the shores of a vast and glorious ocean.</p>
<p>
  Real ocean waves are made of atoms and light, this ocean wasjust pure light in
  essence - as was the sandy beach; and the waves camerolling in towards me as
  gigantic mountains of crashing light,overwhelming me completely.
</p>
<p>
  But to put it like this is to do it a tremendous injustice, becausewords
  cannot describe the transformation which took place inside meas these energies
  burst into creation and into life, submerging anddissolving me in the process.
  But these are the limits of my words, andyou, the reader, will have to search
  deep within yourself to perhapstecall the distant memory when you too bathed
  in the water of life -before you were born into earthly existence.
</p>
<p>
  ‘There was no fear, because there was only light, and the wavesthat rolled
  towards me crashed through me, lifting me into anunknown ecstasy, There was no
  letting up: wave after wave rolled overme and when I thought I could stand no
  more a greater joy swallowedme up and carried me with it into lands of bliss.
</p>
<p>
  But as I said, this was not a place for words. Words belong to a farlower
  level of consciousness than even thought, and I had left thoughtslong behind
  in a universe which appeared now like dense darkness ofignorance in comparison
  to this. Thoughts are simply of a nature toogross, I realised - too coarse to
  touch the fabric of the matter tearing andhammering at my soul. There were
  universes upon universes, each onecreated by a crashing wave and each one
  ripped away and destroyedby the next, There was no repetition of universes;
  everything was newat every moment.
</p>
<p>
  T then realised that everything that had happened was a processof purification
  of cosmic proportions. When the tide ebbed away therewas immense peace.
  Nothing stirred, nothing interrupted it. Until nowThad always been aware in my
  life of potentiality. This was potentialrealised to perfection. But there was
  far far more. All stress, all need
</p>
<p>
  and want had gone, everything I had strived for had found fulfillment.Whatever
  I wanted lay there before me in its absolute essence, in totalstillness and
  emptiness combined. But again, of course, the word
</p>
<p>
  emptiness is wrong. I had ceased to be. This was unformed, anunmanifested
  thrill. Until now I had been bathed in something whichcould be understood as
  the cradle or essence of love, but this was farbeyond that. It was a
  super-dimension of choice-less love, which was asclear as crystal. All
  remotely human feelings had been stripped from itand replenished with utter
  purity. It was pure intelligence, pureconsciousness. It was reality in
  essence.
</p>
<p>
  I knew everything, because I was everything. No instrument ofknowledge was
  needed, because all instrumentality was my owncreation. No creation was
  necessary.
</p>
<p>“Tam what I am.”</p>
<p>“Lam.”</p>
<p>
  I am all. Everyone of us can make these statements. We, as aspecies, are at
  the heart of creation in essence.
</p>
<p>
  Being is at the heart of reality throughout all dimensions and iscontained in
  every moment. It is here in its essence to be recalled at amoment's notice, no
  matter where we are, because it is the very bloodin our veins.
</p>
<p>
  Here, stripped of all that I called myself, I was at the heart ofnature at its
  most powerful, most quintessential. I was omniscient,omnipresent and infinite.
  The instant a question was raised, myuniversal mind had it answered on a level
  unheard of, guided by auniversal wisdom, purpose and plan.
</p>
<p>
  When scientists finally probe into the last remaining mystery ofthe universe,
  this is what they will find and nothing will translate intomathematics,
  formulas or concepts. All this is vanity.
</p>
<p>
  What is life? A thin membrane stretched over a river of ecstasy.Once pierced
  your life will never be the same.
</p>
<p>I dared to raise a question.</p>
<p>“What is to become of me, the creator?”</p>
<p>
  Just when I thought there could be no answer to my question, Iheard new sounds
  rising from the stillness, like flutes opening a whiteinfinite space before me
  with shapes and possibilities undefined. Aninvitation to manifest within
  realms unknown, with adventures stillunrealised and untold.
</p>
<p>
  “This is reality and truth. Man’s true evolution begins here, inpure clarity,
  free of all illusion. The future path of man’s destiny starts
</p>
<p>here, now, to enter dimensions yet incomprehensible and inaccessible,</p>
<p>because man still carries the burden of his animal evolution and</p>
<p>
  instincts to survive in a limited world. A few have stormed ahead toscout the
  way, to fathom what lies beyond.”
</p>
<p>
  I knew I was only at the outer edges of creation and that beyondwaited
  dimensions too far beyond our human state of evolution.
</p>
<p>
  I could travel no further, because this was my true home. I wasrocking gently
  to and fro to a celestial symphony, resting like a baby inits mother’s arms,
  in total trust and surrender, listening to the heartbeatof creation, which
  rolled through me in waves of ecstasy. I felt I couldtake no more and feared
  that if I stayed on I would surrender my veryconsciousness and lose myself in
  the infinite ocean of pure joy.
</p>
<p>
  1 did not want this. I had worked for many years to attainSamadhi and when it
  came I was unprepared. I had to return.
</p>
<p>
  I cannot say how long I was in this region. I felt sanctified.Everything about
  and around me was beautified. I felt whole andholiness was a word which had
  attained its true meaning for me now.
</p>
<p>
  When I came round I was sitting on a bench in a large hall, stillnot in my
  physical body. My face rested in my hands. I was in a state ofrecovery,
  adjustment. My body convulsed with the aftereffects of this
</p>
<p>
  { experience. I tried to control them and get a grip of the thing I
  calledmyself, a curious entity thrown together with molecules and atomsmined
  from eternity and infinity and endowed with a unit ofconsciousness which could
  call itself “me”. Now it was dressed againin ideas, protecting itself for
  whatever reason from the light of truth.
</p>
<p>
  Iam, But what was this ‘I am’, separated from its true reality. Itwas nothing
  but a thought, a dream, an illusion.
</p>
<p>
  Tbecame gradually aware of my surroundings and noticed a mansitting on another
  bench not far from me. He looked vaguely familiar,but I could not place him.
</p>
<p>
  “Have you been through that door?” he asked, pointing at amagnificent entrance
  to some other room. “You could not have,” hesaid then, answering his own
  question. “Ihave been sitting and waitinghere for years and years. You are not
  that advanced to go through thatdoor.”
</p>
<p>
  I had little idea what he was talking about, but I guessed hemeant the
  dimension I had just returned from, that heavenly realm hehad been waiting to
  get into for so long.
</p>
<p>
  T looked at him. I had nothing to reply with - no words to say orthink with. I
  still saw what I had seen behind my eyes and my heartwas struggling to adjust,
  still reeling in the aftermath of such bliss.There was nobody to convince, no
  tales to be told, no witness to bringforward. I knew that it was pointless to
  talk about it. I felt sorry for allthose who may have tried, who fell victim
  to being misunderstood,their listeners mistaking them for saints, turning them
  into prophetsand holy men. I wanted nothing to do with this and had no
  interest inconvincing anybody. That which pulsated through my veins
  pulsatedthrough everybody's. Each one of us is, in that regard, a
  saint,sanctified; each one of us is blessed by our great heritage. I took
  peaceand comfort in the fact that I was like everyone else.
</p>
<p>
  When I looked at the man in front of me I wanted to say, “Don’twait and don’t
  try; you are already there.”
</p>
<p>
  He looked at me. Then I noticed other people, a group crowdingaround me, but
  it wasn’t me they were crowding around - it was a manby my side, who I
  recognised as a master and a friend. It was he who
</p>
<p>
  s=-had been with me and had escorted me into the dimension I had justreturned
  from.
</p>
<p>
  He turned towards me and said chirpily: “Its time to go. Saygoodbye to the
  chappy with the great golden key.”
</p>
<p>
  I burst out laughing, because I realised he was referring to themythological
  keeper of Heaven's Gate, St. Peter of the Christian faith. Iwas happy to be
  human again.
</p>
<p>
  Other people in the group were laughing and making flippant,disrespectful,
  human comments. The great master made me appreciatehow natural it was to enter
  into such a state.
</p>
<p>
  As our group went through the great hall we passed gigantictapestries. This
  was a true palace with huge arched ceilings andmarbled floors and walls, but
  of such abundance and craftsmanshipthat they could only be fashioned in
  thought. People of our group werepointing and talking. After a while we passed
  enormous windows andI looked out into wide open country. We descended many
  flights of
</p>
<p>
  stairs. The master asked questions, but I was still too preoccupied withwhat I
  had seen to pay much attention to them. The next time I lookedout of the
  window I saw a sky covered with silver cloud. Theatmosphere had become
  distinctly Earthly. I could see numerous riverssnaking across the countryside,
  and many people working. I sawbulldozers and bizarre heavy machinery and
  wondered about themeaning of it all.
</p>
<p>
  ‘The master noticed my puzzlement, He asked if I could explainwhat I was
  seeing,
</p>
<p>I said, "Judging by the clouds and the light in the sky and the use</p>
<p>|| of such heavy machinery, I'd say we must be on a dimension very close</p>
<p>
  | to our Earth.” The master laughed approvingly. It was strange thatdespite
  his familiarity and friendliness I could not work out where Iknew him from,
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we exited the building and the group dispersed. Iwatched the workmen
  having fun with their equipment by stagingplay fights, clashing their diggers
  against each other, yelling andlaughing like schoolboys.
</p>
<p>
  knew it was time to go back to my own familiar territory. I spenta few moments
  running through the events, knowing that withoutimpressing them on my brain
  all I had experienced would be lost.
</p>
<p>
  When I woke up I was slumped over in my chair. I ran once again[ through the
  events, without moving a muscle. The inside of my head felt likea brightly
  illuminated hall. I sat in total peace, reliving it all. There was astrong
  light right at the top of my skull. I smirked when the thought of acartoon
  light bulb slipped into my mind. “To see the light’ is an expression weall
  take for granted, but why don’t we remember what the light is? I relishedthe
  fact that what I had seen was real, not a dream.Finally, I got up out of my
  chair. It was just after eight in the morning.Julia was still asleep, and she
  looked very peaceful. I peeked into my littledaughter's room, where she lay
  nestled up in her cot.What a miracle creation is, I thought.Imade tea. I got
  dressed. I felt different.‘There was a presence with me, which I had carried
  back into my worldfrom that other dimension. It showed there was continuity to
  life, whichspans all levels of consciousness. The presence was with me as I
  left the
</p>
<p>
  house, when I crossed the road and walked to the nearby cricket ground.When_I
  acknowledged the presence with a smile, it smiled back at metenfold. I felt
  warmth and affection for it, and it responded withoverwhelming love. I felt
  privileged to be have been chosen to be alive, tocontinue to be allowed to
  live in a universe of such splendor. The presencewas with me like a silent
  companion. It watched my every step. It walkedwith me and everywhere I looked
  I saw it. It confirmed its reality. Everyhumble tree or object I looked at
  told me that it was true.
</p>
<p>
  The world had a wonderful symmetry. The songs of the birds blendedharmoniously
  with the noise of a passing car and the slight breeze rustlingthe branches of
  the trees. My eyes naturally picked out repeating pattern onthe tarmac of the
  path in front of me, reassembling it like a Persian carpet.This is a beautiful
  place, I thought, and as humans we are chosen to share itwith its creator.
</p>
<p>
  Alas, our physical brain is a powerful organ, rooted firmly in our
  three-dimensional world. However lofty our experiences, they cannot stand
  theirground in the harsh light of man-made reality, and soon my journal
  entrywas filed under ‘Extraordinary Experiences’ and left there for
  twenty-five ]years, It took allthis time and regular deep meditation to coax
  this presence |subtly and gradually back into my life as a silent reality.
</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>What is reality?</p>
<p>
  If some reputable scientists were to say, “I am very sorry, but you
  aremistaken. We have conclusive proof that what you experienced and whatyou
  have recorded in your journals is nothing more than one big illusion, afigment
  of your imagination,” then my answer would probably be, “thankyou for telling
  me; I have suspected it myself for a long time now, but wouldyou mind
  including my physical experiences as well?”
</p>
<p>
  One may wonder whether visits to, or ‘visions’ of, other dimensions,like in
  the previous chapter, however real when experienced, hold anysignificance for
  our life in the physical reality at all. I suspect that they mayhave a similar
  relevance as music and art has. It was a vision, an event in mylife long gone,
  and yet it was nothing less than reality proper, reality in itsessence. It is
  with me wherever I am.
</p>
<p>
  It proved to me that at the core of all experience lies an inner reality,which
  is pure and universal. But the most important realisation is that onedoes not
  have to scale the highest mountain or zoom through multipledimensions to find
  it. It is here with us now. The fact that we exist is proofenough.
</p>
<p>
  Reality is a strange thing and as a species we have an ambiguousrelationship
  with it. Yet it is the only thing that counts in life.
</p>
<p>
  You can divide the people who have a good grip on reality into fourcategories:
  they are either very rich, very successful or very happy, or allthree of
  these. If we tune into reality we acquire the best possible ways forsurvival
  by considering facts and the laws of nature, society, economy and allthe other
  rules that govern our lives. Ironically though, however rich or
</p>
<p>
  successful or happy we may be, if we don’t grasp reality at its core we
  stillwon't live in a real world and will most probably be left wanting more.
  Wehaven't arrived at the real wealth and the real success in our lives
  andconsequently still feel lacking. Without a foundation in its essence, the
  realitywe perceive is no more than a deception.
</p>
<p>
  A revolution is taking place, a paradigm shift in consciousness. Nature'sway
  of digging us out of our hole is by shifting our universal awareness to anew
  level. Mankind is waking up to the reality at the core level to save
  itselffrom self-destruction.
</p>
<p>
  We are becoming aware of the present, the now, because it is here thatwe start
  controlling our world and our destiny as a species.
</p>
<p>
  The awakening to the reality of the present is a global phenomena.Mankind is
  rising from its dream. Nothing less than our survival is at stake.We are
  awakening from our madness of self-destruction and beginning to seewho we
  really are and what creates our world. Until now we relied on beliefsand
  hearsay instead of awareness of what is in order to make sense of theworld.
</p>
<p>
  Countless religions and belief systems have been created to serve us thetruth
  like a ready made dish. Once one meal has been consumed thenanother one is
  served immediately, because our minds can never be satisfied.Alll theory,
  religion and philosophy has a limited shelf life.
</p>
<p>
  Beliefs are rigid and we have witnessed societies crumble that werebuilt on
  ideas. Scientific beliefs and hypothesis fare no better. The little weknow is
  called quickly into question and is replaced by something more‘fundamental’.
  But scientists, too, are awakening and beginning to realisethat the ultimate
  truth or theory of everything cannot be found within theconfines of an
  external reality, because the external world has long mergedwith our minds.
  This has turned out to be our great illusion, because we seeourselves divorced
  from the world. Scientists with fresh minds will soonbegin to explore the next
  dimension from within them and then begin to diga tunnel from both ends until
  the next dimension becomes our new frontier.
</p>
<p>
  New modes of operation are being deployed and they can only befound in the
  present. Nothing else is dynamic enough. Nothing else holds thepower to unlock
  the great remaining mysteries.
</p>
<p>
  Until now we despaired when our beliefs crumbled in the face ofTeality, but
  soon we will see only our liberation. The present can’t crumble.All we need to
  do is to surrender to its reality: the now.
</p>
<p>
  The moment we submit to the present our new consciousness makesreality the
  most beautiful part of being human, and living in a physicaldimension becomes
  a great privilege. We meet challenges with eagerness,keen to learn, to
  progress, to satisfy our need to pursue our potential, toadjust and to create
  for ourselves a beautiful and ever-changing world, Weare facing up to reality
  as a training ground for our evolution. We have tiredof trying to escape from
  it. We are realising that our creeds have run theircourse and our escape
  strategies and our addiction to beliefs are shallow and
</p>
<p>empty.</p>
<p>
  We are discovering that the reason for our unhappiness is that we areout of
  touch with reality. We are beginning to redefine our lives in thiscomplex
  world until it becomes simple and authentic.
</p>
<p>
  Adapting our strategies to be dynamic has become essential for oursurvival in
  the physical world, but most of all we are learning how to BE inthe PRESENT.
  We don’t need books or any teachers to tell us how to wake upfrom our dreams
  in the morning and we won't be needing books when wewake in our new
  consciousness. We will simply step into a new awareness ofthe present and
  realise that it was, is, always here. :
</p>
<p>
  We are not cut off cells, but constituent parts of a gigantic universal=
  organism which always was, always is and always will be, because that is the
</p>
<p>
  very nature of the present, which is with us NOW. How can we notsurrender to
  it? It is the greater part of us, tuned in to our innermost nature,supporting
  us as we go about living. We can never be alone.
</p>
<p>
  Every moment is new. Every morning we get up is a new experience.There is no
  repetition. The present becomes our presence, our friend, a latentecstasy
  ready to pour itself into our hearts at the slightest provocation. Aspace of
  infinite peace and inspiration.
</p>
<p>
  Some people who experience it choose to call it God. That's OK,because you
  don’t need to believe in God any longer. If God does not presentitself, then
  people call on ‘faith’ or ‘belief’ and only confirm their separationfrom it.
  Belief has no part of the new consciousness - experience andrealisation is
  taking its place.
</p>
<p>
  We are all standing at the platform waiting for our train to arrive to takeus
  to the next dimension. All life is about death. Death is always lurking inthe
  background. But because we are accustomed to seeing it as an end to liferather
  than a new beginning we stare at it with trepidation and associate it
</p>
<p>
  with dread and fear. The Buddhist idea to a happy life is to embrace
  deathevery day with joyful anticipation, because in reality death is just
  anotherthing that happens on our long journey through eternal life. Every day
  weare moving closer towards the door, beyond which a new life of
  greatadventure, new opportunities and mystery awaits us. Imagine a life
  withoutfear and full of joyful anticipation, where every day presents us with
  anotheropportunity to prepare ourselves for a greater life. All our dreams
  will cometrue, our greatest ambitions realised. The moment we allow
  joyfulanticipation to rule our hearts and lives we open ourselves to the
  present andbreach the great divide. We don’t even have to wait for our big day
  to arrive.Itis here already - now - every moment. Fear is not part of it, only
  joy and theecstasy of the moment. We have nothing to fear, because reality is
  eternal,timeless and limitless. When all our thoughts have taken their
  allocated* places to serve and not to control us, only silence remains, and it
  will take us
</p>
<p>
  to our true home.By surrendering to the present, we will all realise our
  universal nature
</p>
<p>and become true multidimensional beings.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>Multidimensional model</p>
<p>
  The Diagram shows a crude model of the dimensions. It could be reversed,the
  physical on the inside, the higher dimensions on the outside, or it couldbe_a
  flat infinite plane. The model does not adequately lend itself for
</p>
<p>
  illustration for obvious reason, as we are really dealing with states
  ofconsciousness.
</p>
<p>Multidimensional model:</p>
<p>Physical Dimension‘a Physical Universes</p>
<p>Higher DimensionsMental or HeavenDimensions</p>
<p>DimensionalCounter Parts</p>
<p>Physical Dimension& Physical Universes</p>
<p>
  However, this diagram should provide an idea of the relationshipsbetween the
  dimensions. The physical dimensions on the outside indicatethere could be any
  number of physical universes. Ours is just one of the blackdots. Please note
  the globular strings on the right, getting bigger as theyreach down towards
  their original source. The underlying universes are
</p>
<p>
  - massively larger than the physical one, which is only a minute fraction of
  thewhole. The higher-dimensional universes get larger and more numerous asthey
  approach their origin, and they acquire massive increases of creativepower the
  closer they get. There could be any number of creations withinfinite
  dimensions and unlimited universes. They are linear as well asparallel. Each
  globular hierarchy represents a universe with its underlyingcounterpart,
  getting more massive as the dimensions approach their origin.
</p>
<p>
  A similar model can be applied to the Solar system, with the physicalplanets
  represented by the dark dots sitting on the outer surface of the skin;and
  further into the model are other planets, which have not manifested inthe
  physical solar system. Their counterparts on the nonphysical
  dimensionsincrease in number as well as dimension the closer they get to their
  original
</p>
<p>
  ; creation dimension, which means there are_additional planets in the solar|
  system that don't have a physical counterpart at all.
</p>
<p>
  So on each dimension there are numerous counterparts of Earth, gettinglarger
  and larger (so there is never any chance of any overcrowding).
</p>
<p>
  Contrary to what the diagram suggests, the dimensions towards thecreative
  centre become vaster exponentially. It is best to imagine it ascreative
  trickle-down effect. As the matter becomes coarser and
  densertoward_physical_manifestation, the manifestation becomes
  progressivelysparser until we get to the relatively sparsely populated
  physical universe.Scientists estimate that our visible universe is only 4% of
  its total. The rest ismade out of dark matter. The phrase ‘dark matter’
  indicates simply that wedon't know what the matter is. I would rather call it
  the ‘light matter’,consistent with the model as a representation of
  multidimensionality, whichaccount for the bits science can't explain as yet.
  The problem science faces isthat as soon as it unlocks the mystery of the next
  dimension beneath thestructure of our matter and the universe, it will find
  another dimensionimmediately, which is just as hard to penetrate, and so on
  and on.
</p>
<p>
  The only way to solve the mystery adequately is through consciousnesswith a
  scientific mindset, but it has got to reach beyond thought. Theproblem is that
  when scientists reach that point they will probably
</p>
<p>
  understand the relative insignificance of their quest in the light of what
  theyexperience. But it’s worth trying, from a very human point-of-view.
</p>
<p>
  The comparison is a bit like seeing our galaxy as representing thephysical
  universe and the whole universe with its billions of galaxies as thehigher
  dimensions.
</p>
<p>
  But the higher we go into them, the more diverse things become.
  Whenexperiencing what I referred to as the ‘heavens’, I noticed their
  structureseemed to be formed like an infinite sponge, with one chamber leading
  to thenext, divided only by shifts of awareness rather than space._,
</p>
<p>
  Although the diagram shows only five membranes, they are in factsubdivided
  much more than could be illustrated, whereas in the narrative, Isubdivided
  them into six: physical, Earth-like, intermediate, higher, heaven,and _pure
  reality. Pure reality may yet consist of further subdivisions, whichmay be
  beyond reach for man at its present evolutionary stage. Also,
</p>
<p>
  — different parallel universes become accessible the higher the
  consciousnessrises. Space travel is possible already on the next dimension
  from Earthbecause there space can be collapsed, but only for the
  out-of-body-traveller atpresent.
</p>
<p>
  To collapse linear time, a still higher dimension is required, and at alower
  level only the past can be accessed”s,
</p>
<p>
  As with any theory, interpretations of my experiences are wide open todebate.
  After all, mine are the observations of an artist rather than a
  qualifiedtheoretical scientist or mathematician.
</p>
<p>
  I would be keen to read out-of-body reports from astrophysicists andother
  scientists. All they need to do to find ‘the answer’ is to pose thequestion
  when out of their body and allow the magnetic energy of theirdesire for
  knowledge to guide them to the right source.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, when illustrating a book on Deep Space, I became fascinatedabout the
  question of the origin of our universe. When out of my body Iposed the
  question of how the universe began I hoped to become the
</p>
<p>
  eyewitness to the Big Bang. To my great surprise I was confronted with
  foursounds. I know that scientifically sounds are the result of waveforms; but
  arethey really? Could there be another dimension where sound creates waveforms
  rather than the other way around? And what is sound anyway? Soundplays an
  incredibly important role when visiting the higher dimensions.
</p>
<p>
  At the moment the only theory we have is still the Big Bang, but I amsure we
  will become more specific as our knowledge increases.
</p>
<p>Appendix B</p>
<p>The super powers</p>
<p>
  Very early on in my investigations I concluded that objective creation
  existson other dimensions in exactly the same way as creation exists in the
  physicaluniverse, regardless of the observer. The idea that we are dealing
  with vagueor vaporous matter - the product of dreams and imagination - is
  utterlyabsurd when waking in the actual environment of the higher
  dimensions.Experiencing firsthand such a vast and magnificent world with such
  clarityand detachment is just something that cannot be conveyed adequately
  inwords,
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand it is tempting to conclude that because the creativepowers
  of imagination, expectation and intention play such an active part inthe
  shaping of the environment, the next dimension is nothing more than aproduct
  of the imagination. But even that doesn’t make it any less real to theobserver
  who finds himself inhabiting that dimension, Once the physicalviewpoint has
  disappeared, upon entering the next dimension, we will getaccustomed to a
  totally new experience of reality, one that follows new andexciting laws.
</p>
<p>
  ‘My most important observation was that the energy of creation on thesehigher
  dimension is far more pliable and adaptable to various forces than o1the
  physical strata. The major one is the universal force of creation, the
  samewhich brought our physical universe into existence. But there are other
  forcesthat manipulate the energy in any way they want, as the energy is so
  muchmore fluid and dynamic than in the physical universe.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas on the physical level we need to employ physical means toshift
  physical matter, on the levels above one employs mental means to shiftmental
  matter, but the mental matter is not less real than physical matter ison the
  physical plane.
</p>
<p>
  Not only are those universes not vaporous, they appear extremely solidonce the
  visitor has taken residence there, in the same way as our physicaluniverse
  appears solid to us. Just because it can be manipulated moredynamically than
  matter on Earth doesn’t make it less real, in the same way
</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>
  cothat water is not less real than rock because it can be transformed into ice
  andsteam and can be forced into different molds.
</p>
<p>
  What really determines reality is a state of awareness. The higher werise
  through the inner dimensions and the closer we get to our innermostlayer of
  consciousness, the more powerful the awareness of being and lifebecomes. From
  our earthly viewpoint we prefer to look upon the higherdimension as being
  flimsy, vaporous and phantom-like simply because weplace it firmly in the
  realm of imagination, In fact, the opposite is the case.Once_one has awoken on
  the higher planes, Earth life appears as a dimdream. The power of
  consciousness increases proportionally the higher weascend through the
  different dimensions. All our sensory powers and humanfaculties of awareness
  increase as well. This is why in Buddhism the state ofthe higher consciousness
  is referred to as the awakened state. We have to getused to the idea that we
  are nothing more than universal energy trapped inadream from which we will
  awake gradually into our proper life.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing we will have to get used to is that our new environmentwill be
  much more dynamic and responsive to our thoughts and desires.
</p>
<p>
  Quantum scientists are knocking at the doors of the next dimension,and have
  already discovered that simply by their presence the experimenterhas an effect
  on the behavior of matter on the subatomic level (this is called‘the observer
  effect’), and research is underway to measure the influence ofthought on
  microscopic growth and crystal formation. If this is the effect theobserver
  has on the relatively coarse physical matter, then it is easy tounderstand
  that when we have broken through the barriers of the subatomicstructures into
  the next dimension, these influences are much morepronounced.
</p>
<p>And this is exactly what I found.</p>
<p>
  In this book are many reports that illustrate this point, like the people
  inthe carnival procession shaping matter, including their own bodies,
  intoextravagant shapes, showing that matter in the next dimension is
  infinitelymore pliable, fluid and adaptable to other energy forms such as
  intent andcreative thought. All this will be exploited to the extreme by us as
  humansonce we take a more ‘permanent’ residence in the higher dimensions.
  Beingsuch a very inventive, adaptable and creative species, we come into our
  ownwhen transcending our physical limitations and boundaries after we
  ‘die’.Our passions and energies are set in motion while still on Earth
  andenhanced incredibly on the next dimension.
</p>
<p>
  The inhabitants basically employ five types of power whenmanipulating the
  subtle dimensions; the power of intent, the power ofexpectation, the power of
  the subconscious, the power of desire and thepower of consensus.
</p>
<p>The power of intent</p>
<p>
  I found there are a number of human-induced forces that shape, mold andshift
  matter on other dimensions. One of them is the power of intent. Thiscreative
  force allows the inhabitants, including visitors like myself, tomanipulate the
  matter and the world to an incredible degree and to make itconform to any wish
  we are capable of dreaming up. This power gets moreintense the higher the
  dimension. These energies can be so potent that theycan even include the
  apparent creation of other living entities, which Idescribed when visiting the
  1920s colonisation of an alien planet,
</p>
<p>
  At this point it is worth considering the implication of these forces onthe
  environment of the inhabitants. To my great astonishment I found thatnot only
  the thoughts of the permanent residents shaped their environment,but that we,
  still living on this physical plane, are responsible for some thefeatures of
  their world. On one occasion in the late seventies I was given aguided tour
  through a very modern hotel by the designer on the nexdimension. The modern,
  mold-breaking design was akin to what you cainow find in boutique hotels and
  in some of the most avant-garde architectureand interior design, but
  manifested years before anything like it was built onthe physical level. It
  was no doubt dreamed up by the designers of suchbuildings on the physical
  level and inspired by the resident designers on thatother level.
</p>
<p>
  We can easily imagine the kind of paradise awaiting artists,
  designers,architects and filmmakers over there, where the restrictions of
  money,materials, manpower, gravity and other earthly limitations simply do
  notapply. The environments created there are of such astounding
  creativity,variety and sheer inventiveness, that they would be nigh-on
  impossible toachieve on Earth because of the resilience of our matter and its
  gravitationallaws.
</p>
<p>25 See chapter “Settlers on another planet”</p>
<p>
  The power of expectation‘Another force of creative power is expectation. On
  numerous occasions Ifound that expectation was such a powerful energy it could
  bring objects intoexistence almost instantly. When looking down on my body,
  for example,and wondering what I was wearing, I was always dressed. But I am
  certainthat the power of expectation plays a much greater part in shaping
  theenvironment of the higher dimension.
</p>
<p>
  It is a power which is based on what we know to be true, and it takes itspower
  from an underlying principle in nature which has proven itself overtime and
  evolution. I refer to it as ‘the matrix’. The matrix is a cosmic energypattern
  containing the blueprint of everything in existence, or even thoughtof. Simply
  by expecting something, we conjure up its latent pattern andpropel it into
  existence in an instant. Expectation is such a powerful, directroute to
  creation because it contains no weakening factors like doubt orindecisiveness.
</p>
<p>
  This also applies to motion. The moment we expect to be in a certainplace, we
  are there. If we expect to be dressed we are in the kind of dress orcostume we
  expect. The blueprint of creation is already dormant. It is etched,or
  hardwired, into a cosmic matrix, waiting to be conjured up and releasedinto
  the world. You could compare it to a computer calling up informationfrom its
  hard drive and then running a program.
</p>
<p>
  This principle will become a major point of reliance in the physicalsciences
  of the future, because organising physical atoms around these lawsis only a
  matter of degree.
</p>
<p>
  The power of the subconsciousOther forces at work on the next dimension are
  subconscious forces thatshape our dreams and nightmares. I am certain that the
  dreamworld weenter during sleep borrows its substance from the matter of the
  nonphysicaldimension. As I have never actually witnessed other people's dreams
  I haveconcluded that we, as dreamers, create the dream content, which vibrates
  ona dimension attuned totally to our own vibratory field and therefore
  invisibleto other people. Whether we can enter other people’s dreams I do not
  know,but Ihave never been aware that what I have witnessed was somebody
  else’screation.I have, however, met people who were dreaming. They can
  beidentified by a strange remoteness, sometimes distressed. sometimesagitated,
  very similar to when we come across people who are daydreaming.Ian sense when
  I meet dreamers who have made their way into the nextdimension but are
  engrossed in a dream. Sometimes they are even involvedin some form of activity
  while dreaming, similar to sleepwalkers on thislevel.
</p>
<p>
  Subconscious forces are energies we carry over to the next world. In thehigher
  planes they release the energies of life-long dreams. If we wished for
  asupercar on the physical world, but were never able to earn enough moneyto
  afford it, then the energy builds up in those fantasies and dreams nowcomes to
  the fore and finally our dreams come true. A large part of our
  futureenvironment is based on our dreams and wishes - strong energies built
  upduring our lifetime, now set for release and fulfillment. Science can teach
  usthat energy does not get lost, but triggers other events. The events find
  theirmanifestation on the next dimensions.
</p>
<p>
  On the higher levels we can_all be ‘lottery winners’. If you are areasonably
  positively-charged and motivated person then your dreams willcome true. So you
  can stop buying lottery tickets and be patient instead. Ifyou nurture powerful
  dreams then they will all come true in time.
</p>
<p>
  But if you are negatively charged, selfish and out to get the better ofother
  people to further your game-plan, keep buying those tickets, becausethis will
  be your best chance of fulfilling your dreams. To access the matrix,you need
  positive emotions or you may have a long time to wait.
</p>
<p>
  Negative energies also form part of these subconscious forces. On thelower
  dimension they can have hideous nightmarish manifestations, whichwill create
  another horrific aspect to the life of the individual inhabitants. Thebest
  illustration is that of a criminal who may have murdered or committedan act of
  violence against another person: the negative energy of his victim,and the
  suffering, resentment and anger of the victim’s family, createspowerful forces
  that often manifest in hideous and violent artificial entities.Like wishes,
  these too are energies which accumulate, if they cannot find fullexpression in
  this dimension. These will attach themselves to the criminaland unload their
  viciousness when he or she has the least protection - afterdeath,
</p>
<p>
  Varun ?The power of desireIn occult literature the next dimension to our
  physical one is often referred toas the “desire world”. Emotion is one of the
  predominant and most powerfulforces, but our body on the physical with its
  relatively sluggish neural systemgives us a degree of protection against
  overwhelming emotions. I also foundthat a whole new spectrum of emotions opens
  up to us on the next levelwhich we may never have experienced before here on
  earth. My ownexperience has been that feelings were amplified greatly. Here
  they flowfreely and the person who is not in control of their emotions will
  quickly beconfronted with the effects they conjure up. I could easily break
  into tears ofjoy on the next level when meeting someone I loved and then,
  uponreturning to my physical body, find no trace of that emotion.‘One of the
  most powerful feelings for man or woman is sexual desire.Once it comes to the
  surface on the next level a person is instantly catapultedinto the company of
  like-minded people. I found that these feelings aregenerally more accepted on
  the next level, probably because they are such astrong and integral part of
  our human nature. They are less easily suppressedthere and have been more
  readily accepted as an everyday part of the social7, environment, but that
  doesn’t mean sex is rampant, because people naturallychoose their social
  environment in much the same way as they do on earth.Emotional power can
  create a whole range of artificial entities, whichcan be beautiful angelic
  creatures, brought about by intensive love foranother person, like that of a
  mother for her child or between lovers. I canimagine that Cupid and Amor may
  have originated here. Although their lifeforce is dependent on the will of
  their creators, they are neverthelessconvincing copies of their human
  creators. (More about artificial entities inappendix c.)
</p>
<p>The power of consensus</p>
<p>
  We have seen the vast creative as well as the destructive power of
  thesubconscious. But there is another formidable force which has
  imprinteditself in the next dimensions: the power of consensus - the combined
  creativeforce of man, which on this planet has led to the creation of
  wholecivilisations, cities and cultures. Take this to another level, where the
  physicaland economic laws no longer apply, and you can imagine what man might
  becapable of. The most exiting encounters I discovered was when every aspect
</p>
<p>
  of creation man had achieved on Earth was enhanced exponentially,diversified
  and elaborated on the next dimensions, There were even creationswhich had no
  counterpart anywhere on Earth,
</p>
<p>
  The combined will of creativity can achieve worlds of suchmagnificence and
  grandeur that can leave us Earth dwellers absolutelyspeechless. This communal
  power can create whole worlds - civilisations thatpay homage to us as the
  masters of the universe. In the physical level, we as aspecies have achieved
  great things in architecture, art and culture; but in theabsence of physical
  resistance, and with the pliable and fluid matter of thenext dimension at our
  free disposal, imagination is not hampered by materiallimitation and whatever
  can be imagined on this level is a physical realitysomewhere on the next
  dimension.
</p>
<p>Some_of the cities I saw were tens of thousands of years old:</p>
<p>
  — indestructible by the consensual agreement of the people who lived there.
  Inthe face of this we should prepare ourselves for the greatest adventure of
  ourlives at the moment we pass through the gates of death, and yet it very
  muchdepends on our own capacity of imagination whether we will be attracted
  tolook forward to seeing such grandiose monuments.
</p>
<p>
  It is important, though, to remember the law of attraction. Many of uson this
  planet make little use of our imaginative powers or our sense ofadventure. It
  is obvious that our afterlife environment will be in keeping withwhat we
  expect (i.e. what we are used to), plus elements of our dreams. Thesame is to
  be said about belief systems, which too will create the environmer|sought by
  those who subscribe to it. A vast number of people may quithappily settle in
  environments little different from our physical world; but ofcourse, as
  boredom sets in, so does the desire to extend the comfort zone.
</p>
<p>
  The diversity of our increased power on other levels extends, of
  course,throughout all cultures. It is important to remember that people of
  nationswith unique cultural heritage will enhance their world in line with
  theiridentity.
</p>
<p>
  I once travelled to the higher dimensional counterpart ofThailand. There I
  came across a water-world consisting of thousands oflittle islands. Each
  island was occupied by families or groups of people.The atmosphere was very
  serene. The waterways separating the littleislands were illuminated by
  millions of lanterns, and the richvegetation and flowers on the earth grew to
  such height that they
</p>
<p>
  melded seamlessly into the dwellings of the families in their
  paradisecommunities. Each island was unique and individual and yet blendedwith
  all the others in perfect harmony. There was plenty of singing,
</p>
<p>
  [rus and laughter, and everyone was extremely attractive andfriendly towards
  me.
</p>
<p>
  ‘There was no sense of monotony in this environment. As I driftedthrough the
  island world with a sense of anticipation I found myselfsurprised by the
  unique character of each of the islands, dwellings andstructures. It was a
  continuously unfolding world of wonder. I couldsee children underwater,
  chasing exotic fish and dolphins in thebreathtakingly beautiful reefs. I dived
  in too, (I was able to breathewithout any fear of drowning), and encountered a
  rich underwaterkingdom with a multitude of different creatures I had never
  seen orheard of before.
</p>
<p>
  People who are accustomed to going on regular holidays may well feelinclined
  to spend a few Earth equivalent centuries exploring the higherdimensional
  counterparts of our world when they die.
</p>
<p>Appendix C</p>
<p>Artificial entities - man-made lifeforms</p>
<p>
  The closest we will ever get to creating artificial life forms on this
  physicaldimension is via the construction of robots or nano-bots, which we
  canprogram to perform certain tasks. The further we advance
  technologically,the more realistic such artificial entities will undoubtedly
  become. Butimagine being able to create artificial lifeforms simply by willing
  them intoexistence. This is what can be achieved on the other dimensions, as
  we haveseen in a chapter’ with the alien community who created their staff in
  thisfashion, and even a whole harem of willing concubines.
</p>
<p>
  This is a fascinating subject which will no doubt interest a great
  manyout-of-body travelers and those people on the verge of leaving
  thisdimension permanently and who may be looking forward to taking upresidence
  in the next world.
</p>
<p>26 Settlers on another Planet - Page 136</p>
<p>
  Like the man of the settlers who created his secret cave with dozens ofloving
  and complying women fulfilling his every desire. Though many of usmay take
  exception to this on the grounds of morality, the next world willoffer
  infinite opportunity for the most outrageous imaginations to fulfill
  theirwildest dreams.
</p>
<p>
  At this point it may make sense to explain the true nature of suchmanmade
  artificial entities. What are they made from? And what keeps themalive?
</p>
<p>
  As anybody who has ever written a story or a novel will tell you soonafter
  they have created a character it will develop its own personality. But it’snot
  just authors or actors who create artificial entities that are given a
  spiritby the creator: everybody is doing it all the time in everyday life.
</p>
<p>
  Often, we imagine what another person is like whom we barely knowand we tend
  to fill our lack of knowledge by weaving a personality aroundthem. This
  personality, of course, is our own projection. How often do wefind ourselves
  surprised that the person turns out to be quite different fromhow we imagined
  them to be?
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, we cannot see them in this world, but on the next dimension.they
  are real, and instead of talking to the real person we address our
  fantasy(unless the real person is a powerful enough force to pierce this
  fantasy). Wefeed them with our thought power and keep them alive for as long
  as wemaintain our attention on them. The moment we withdraw our attention,they
  fade into the matter of that plane and are reconstituted when calleupon.
</p>
<p>
  So, the appearance of these entities is a reflection of the thoughwishes,
  emotions and affections of their creator. The many beautiful ladiethe settler
  created for his harem were a reflection of his devotion and love forthem and
  sexual desire. They looked extremely beautiful and developed theirown
  personalities, They interacted not only with their creator, but with eachother
  and when I met them they even interacted with me and it was hard totell
  whether they were real or imagined. The same was true of the other staff- the
  chauffeurs, butlers and maids. To me, as an outsider, they appeared likeflesh
  and blood people.
</p>
<p>
  It has to be pointed out that this applies in a positive as well as in
  anegative sense. On the few occasions that I have visited the lower realms,
  theability to create artificial entities has had hideous consequences. Evil
  thoughtcreates evil entities. The folklore of vampires and werewolves may have
  their
</p>
<p>
  origin here, and these are just scratching the surface of the depths to
  whichhuman depravation can sink. I saw evil hideously contorted entities that|
  even preyed on and tormented their creator, who battled with themcontinually.
  They also attacked other dwellers of those realms. Forillustration purposes we
  only have to look at the horror film genre or at someof our own nightmares to
  get the picture. They are powerless against peoplewho have no link to these
  type of vibrations and even if we encounteredthem by accident or out of
  curiosity we would likely be invisible to them.
</p>
<p>
  It is fair to say that our planet is surrounded by a belt of negativeenergy -
  thought forms created by selfish and evil-minded people both livingand_dead.
  We have all witnessed them during nightmares, when a weakerpart of ourselves
  has opened itself up to fear, maybe from watching a horrorfilm late at night
  or being subjected to real life torment during the day. Atnight fear opens a
  sympathetic communication line which connects us to the‘demon belt’, which can
  populate our nightmares with the most hideousmonsters and events.
</p>
<p>
  People with powerfully positive personalities create their ownbenevolent
  artificial entities that make everybody who comes into theirProximity feel
  good. They are ready to help and reach out to anyone whoneeds them. Some
  clairvoyants refer to them as angels. They are the faithfulservants of their
  creators, who can send them to anybody who they feelwould need their help and
  their presence will release powerful beneficialenergy on the recipient no
  matter where they are.
</p>
<p>
  Not everybody creates such persistent entities. Castaneda” called them‘allies’
  in his books - powerful manifestations of sorcerers, who can alsodestroy the
  keeper if not properly controlled. All black and white magicmakes use of these
  features of the next dimension.
</p>
<p>
  For us Earth-bound citizens, they have only a very temporary
  lifespan,sometimes no more than minutes or seconds before their substance
  iswithdrawn by our fading attention.

<p>Further study and self exploration</p>
<p>
  No doubt many readers will want to find out for themselves what it is like
  tovisit dimensions beyond the physical. As I mentioned in the book,
  followingtechniques specifically designed to reach these levels was never my
  maininterest or strength. My prime motivation was to reach higher states
  ofconsciousness via meditation. You will find there are plenty of
  websitesinterested in making money by promising quick results via their
  owntechniques. Finding ways into altered states of consciousness doesn’t have
  tocost more money than the price of a paperback. Techniques abound. Youcan't
  go far wrong by following the techniques of psychologist StephenLaBerge of
  Stanford University who made it his life's work to study luciddreams. He
  developed a number of powerful methods laid out in his bookson Lucid Dreaming.
  The most important requirements are a keen interest, thedesire to achieve,
  motivation and persistence.
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in meditation there are many techniques and evenmore
  teachers. It is worth bearing in mind that the prime objective ofmediation is
  personal liberation and realisation of reality. There are many so-called gurus
  who are keen to make money or enroll you into a cult. Cults arethe opposite to
  personal freedom. You will find guidance from within onceyou start mastering
  simple meditation techniques (please refer to theRecommended Reading at the
  end of the book).
</p>
<p>
  The beauty of meditation is that it transforms your life and, like yoga, iis
  all about balance. It is better to meditate for 20 minutes twice a day
  thar.for hours at a time, which can lead to imbalance. To rely on common
  sense,gut instinct and intuition is better than following a cult or believe
  system.
</p>
<p>
  Your teacher is within you. Any teacher you may encounter in thisworld or on
  the next level will only have your personal freedom andliberation at heart and
  will have no interest in turning you into a follower orselling you a belief
  system (and they usually have a great sense of humor andtend not to take
  themselves too seriously). As you unfold with meditation,your perception will
  clear, ego identification will give way to a deepappreciation of fellow life
  forms, personal freedom and a sense of anunderlying joy and ecstasy in
  everyday life. The beauty of this physicalworld is that there is no ‘magic’.
  The ‘magic’ of our physical dimension isthat the cosmos follows the perfect
  and beautiful laws of nature. The next
</p>
<p>
  dimension promises environments of unimaginable magic, but on closerinspection
  we will find that it is just an expansion of the perfect laws of theuniverse.
  Unhappiness is the result of not being able to embrace reality. Tosurrender
  and embrace the reality of this dimension in the present is trulyempowering
  and liberating and the source of happiness.
